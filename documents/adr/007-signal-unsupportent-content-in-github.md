# 7. Signal Unsupported Contents in the Repository

Date: 2024-08-30

## Status

Pending Community Feedback

## Context

The FedRAMP OSCAL automation team needs to cleanup the repository periodically, and establish a way to signal to the community areas of the repository that are no longer maintened (e.g., legacy proof-of-concept tools, outdated documentation / guidance, etc.).

### Possible Solutions

Signal unsupported code / content in the repository by:
1. marking the content as **DEPRECATED** in a README
2. **OBSOLETE** in a README
 - deleting **OBSOLETE** content from future releases and leaving archival copies in an archive branch for posterity
3. marking the content as **ARCHIVED** and moving to an “archived” folder
   
## Consequences

The above will be applied to the current repository as follows:  
* **dist/content/rev4**  
  * Add README \- FR has transitioned to Rev 5\.  Rev 4 baselines, resources, and templates are no longer maintained but will be kept frozen for historical purposes.
  * Mark as **DEPRECATED**
* **dist/content/rev5/resources**  
  * Archive README \- letting community know FedRAMP is transitioning from *fedramp\_extensions.xml* & *fedramp\_values.json*
    * FedRAMP to consider future work on replacing them with report of constraints auto-generated by CI or OSCAL-CLI (from Metaschema constraints)  
* **dist/content/rev5/templates**  
  * Update README clarifying intent of FedRAMP “template” and documenting known validation issues with each template.  Where possilbe, FedRAMP will attempt to fix template validation issues to reduce the amount of errors they produce.  
* **documents** folder  
  * Update README sending community to [https://automate.fedramp.gov](https://automate.fedramp.gov) for documentation going forward.  Add statement about PDF guides no longer being maintained and that existing GH issues submitted about the guides will be address via updates to [https://automate.fedramp.gov](https://automate.fedramp.gov)   
    * **documents/rev4/README.md** \- mark as **OBSOLETE** and remove PDF guides
    * **documents/rev5/README.md** \- mark as **OBSOLETE** and remove PDF guides
* presentations folder  
  * **presentations/data-bites**  
    * Update with latest Data Bites slides  
  * Add **presentations/oscal-implementers**
    * Update with latest OSCAL Implementers slides
* **src/examples/README.md** \- **ARCHIVED**
  * Delete all current contents
* **src/utils/extensions-preview.xsl** \- **ARCHIVED**
  * Move all current contents to archive subfolder (e.g., **src/examples/archived** )
* **validations** folder \- **ARCHIVED**
  * Move all current contents to archive subfolder (e.g., **src/validations/archived** )
  * Update the README to let community know this is now archived and no longer maintained  
* **validations/constraints** \- Plan on adding new validation constraints and associated documentation that is currently in the *feature/external-extensions* branch.
  * Once merged from that feature branch and a release is created, it will be available in the master branch for the community.
