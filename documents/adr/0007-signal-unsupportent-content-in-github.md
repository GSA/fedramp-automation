# 7. Signal Unsupported Contents in the Repository

Date: 2024-09-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The FedRAMP Automation Team must maintain organization of its repositories, including deprecation and migration information for data, tools, and documentation as part of its release strategy.

### Possible Solutions

Several possible solutions for identifying deprecated and migrated data, tools, and documentation are below.

1. Do nothing, leave all data, tools, and documentation as-is
1. Marking the content as **DEPRECATED** in the relevant READMEs
1. Leverage [the current release strategy and semantic versioning](https://github.com/GSA/automate.fedramp.gov/blob/f085168bc485cf764a37c148d3a3109507d4695a/content/about/release.md):
  - identify deprecation of relevant data, tools, and documentation in README with an **OBSOLETE** label in the relevant READMEs;
    - make a minor release with deprecation information in those READMEs;
    - make a major release with deprecated content deleted and new data, tools, and documentation released
1. Mark deprecated content by labelling relevant READMEs as **ARCHIVED** and move all relevant content to “archive” folder
 ## Decision
 
 The FedRAMP Automation Team will implement Solution 3: identify tools, data, and content for migration, deprecation, remove content accordingly by saving them in an archival minor release and deleting them in a major version release.
   
## Consequences

For the purposes of this ADR, there is an inventory for this repository of different tools, data, documentation, and their future deprecation below.

* **dist/content/rev4**  
  * Add README \- FR has transitioned to Rev 5\.  Rev 4 baselines, resources, and templates are no longer maintained but will be kept frozen for historical purposes.
  * Mark as **DEPRECATED**
* **dist/content/rev5/resources**  
  * Archive README \- letting community know FedRAMP is transitioning from *fedramp\_extensions.xml* & *fedramp\_values.json*
    * FedRAMP to consider future work on replacing them with report of constraints auto-generated by CI or OSCAL-CLI (from Metaschema constraints)  
* **dist/content/rev5/templates**  
  * Update README clarifying intent of FedRAMP “template” and documenting known validation issues with each template.  Where possilbe, FedRAMP will attempt to fix template validation issues to reduce the amount of errors they produce.  
* **documents** folder  
  * Update README sending community to [https://automate.fedramp.gov](https://automate.fedramp.gov) for documentation going forward.  Add statement about PDF guides no longer being maintained and that existing GH issues submitted about the guides will be address via updates to [https://automate.fedramp.gov](https://automate.fedramp.gov)   
    * **documents/rev4/README.md** \- mark as **OBSOLETE** and remove PDF guides
    * **documents/rev5/README.md** \- mark as **OBSOLETE** and remove PDF guides
* presentations folder  
  * **presentations/data-bites**  
    * Move to [https://automate.fedramp.gov](https://automate.fedramp.gov) and update with latest Data Bites slides  
  * Add **presentations/oscal-implementers** folder in the automate.fedramp.gov repository
    * Update with latest OSCAL Implementers slides
* **src/examples/README.md** \- **ARCHIVED**
  * Delete all current contents
* **src/utils/extensions-preview.xsl** \- **ARCHIVED**
  * Delete all current contents
* **validations** folder \- **ARCHIVED**
  * Delete all current contents
  * Update the README to let community know this is now archived and no longer maintained  
* **validations/constraints** \- Plan on adding new validation constraints and associated documentation that is currently in the *feature/external-extensions* branch.
  * Once merged from that feature branch and a release is created, it will be available in the master branch for the community.
