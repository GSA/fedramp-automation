# 12. Constraint Prioritization Strategy ADR 
Date: 2024-09-26

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The FedRAMP Automation Team requires a consistent strategy and methodology for prioritizing and performing work on FedRAMP constraints. This ADR documents the key decisions in how FedRAMP will develop and maintain constraints, in order to provide transparency to stakeholders and guide contributors to this work.  

## Decision

The FedRAMP Automation Team recognizes the need to develop automation capabilities in the context of current FedRAMP policies, guidance, and review standards. 
Within this context, the Team recognizes three tiers of automation:
- **Completeness Checks**: Ensure the presence of required content and attachments within the package submission. Typically defined and performed using Metaschema constraints. Examples include ensuring cloud service and delivery models are provided, as well as at least one boundary diagram, one network diagram and one data flow diagram.
- **Integrity Checks**: Focus on data correlation and consistency checks within the OSCAL content, similar to database referential integrity checks. Some of this can be performed with Metaschema constraints; however, some may require another mechanism to fully address. Examples include ensuring components referenced in SSP controls and SAR findings are actually defined and resolvable in the OSCAL content.
- **Reviewer Automation**: Advanced and complex digital package quality checks that support decision-makers in understanding the CSOâ€™s risk posture. Examples include determining whether a described solution adequately satisfies a defined control requirements, and ensuring that cited cryptographic modules are deployed consistent with the FIPS validation parameters.  

This ADR focuses on Metaschema constraints related to **Completeness Checks** and **Integrity Checks**.

### Approach

1. The Team will align automation activity to the FedRAMP Templates and Review Checklists for FedRAMP Baselines based on NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5.
1. The Team will assess each automation activity as something that:
  1. is fully automatable via metaschema constraints or other means; or
  1. requires human judgment, thus is more suited to a workflow.
1. For each template element or review task, the Team will identify the applicable completness and integrity checks, as well as identify any reviewer automation that may be necessary to fully achieve the desired adjudication activity.
1. The Team will prioritize and logically group related constraints into Epics, defined in the FedRAMP Automation GitHub repository.
1. The Team will bundle work into milestones and releases that ensure stakeholders are able to use constraints sooner. 

### Prioritization

The Team will adhere to the following prioritization principles:
- Simple constraints over complex 
- Prioritizing higher value, lower effort constraints first
- Focus on items that apply to all impact levels (H/M/L)

### Delivery Themes 

The Team will work in the following sequence:
- Theme 1: Completeness Checks
- Theme 2: Data and Referential Integrity Checks 
- Theme 3: Reviewer Automation

All contributors to constraint development will ensure all contributions adhere to the [Definition of Done](https://github.com/GSA/fedramp-automation/wiki/Constraint-Management#definition-of-done), which includes updating the documentation in accordance with the [Documentation Standards](https://github.com/GSA/fedramp-automation/wiki/Constraint-Management#documentation-standards).

## Consequences

By focusing on completeness checks first, the Team is able to publish more constraints in a shorter period of time, exposing pilot team participants to as many constraints as possible in as short a time as possible. 
Further, completeness checks represent an excellent effort/value ratio in terms of stakeholders being able to validate packages prior to submission.

The trade-off for focusing on completeness checks first is that several checks that represent challenges for SSP authors may be more valuable, but are delayed due to having greater complexity. There is also a risk that our approach to simple tasks doesn't scale as well as the team expects.
