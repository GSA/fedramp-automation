        <title>Corrective Action Information Type</title>
        <description>Corrective Action involves the enforcement functions necessary to remedy programs that have been found non-compliant with a given law, regulation, or policy. The recommended security categorization for the corrective action information type is as follows:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-low</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of corrective action information on the ability of responsible agencies to remedy internal or external programs that have been found non-compliant with a given law, regulation, or policy. Unauthorized disclosure of most corrective action information should have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where more sensitive information is involved, it will probably be personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 or information that is proprietary to a corporation or other organization. Such information will often be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact level. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Additionally, there are legislative mandates prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets. Trade secrets will generally be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact level.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for corrective action information is low.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the corrective action information. The availability impact is also dependent on whether the data is time-critical. In most cases, disruption of access to corrective action information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>The provisional availability impact level recommended for corrective action information is low.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The consequences of undetected unauthorized modification or destruction of corrective action information can conceivably compromise the effectiveness of compliance enforcement actions (e.g., by providing violators with a basis for claiming investigative or enforcement irregularities, thus supporting legal challenges to proposed corrective actions). The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Unauthorized modification or destruction of most corrective action information should have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.</integrity_explanation>

        <title>Program Evaluation</title>
        <description>Program Evaluation involves the analysis of internal and external program effectiveness and the determination of corrective actions as appropriate. The impact levels should be commensurate with the impact levels of the program that is being evaluated. For example, if the program contains very sensitive financial data with moderate impact levels for confidentiality and integrity, the program evaluation impact levels for confidentiality and integrity should also be moderate. The recommended security categorization for the program evaluation information type is as follows:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-low</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of program evaluation information on the abilities of responsible agencies to analyze internal and external program effectiveness and to determine appropriate corrective actions. The confidentiality impact of program evaluation information is largely event-driven. Once the evaluation has been reported, most program evaluation information is in the public domain. However, premature unauthorized disclosure of program evaluation information can alert personnel associated with programs under evaluation to the focus and preliminary findings of investigative and evaluation activities. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where a major programs or human safety is at stake, actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure of program evaluation information can pose a threat to human life or a loss of major assets. In such cases, the confidentiality impact is high. Unauthorized disclosure of most program evaluation information often has the potential to seriously affect agency operations. Also, some program evaluation information, particularly in the case of current investigations, includes personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 and/or information that is proprietary to a corporation or other organization. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Additionally, there are legislative mandates prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets. Trade secrets will generally be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact level. If the program evaluation information is moved to the public domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes Not Applicable (NA).</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>Because there are many cases in which unauthorized disclosure of program evaluation information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for program evaluation information is low.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the program evaluation information. Although there are time-sensitive exceptions, most program evaluation processes are tolerant of reasonable delays. In most cases, disruption of access to program evaluation information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>The provisional availability impact level recommended for program evaluation information is low.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The consequences of undetected unauthorized modification or destruction of program evaluation information can compromise the effectiveness of an evaluation program (e.g., by providing false information intended to mislead investigators or evaluators or to give program personnel a basis for claiming investigative or evaluative irregularities). The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Although there are time-sensitive exceptions, unauthorized modification or destruction of most program evaluation information should have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.</integrity_explanation>

        <title>Program Monitoring</title>
        <description>Program Monitoring involves the data-gathering activities required to determine the effectiveness of internal and external programs and the extent to which they comply with related laws, regulations, and policies. The impact levels should be commensurate with the impact levels of the programs that are being monitored. For example, if a program contains very sensitive financial data with moderate impact levels for confidentiality and integrity, the program monitoring impact levels for confidentiality and integrity should also be moderate. Subject to exception conditions described below, the recommended security categorization for the program monitoring information type is as follows:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-low</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of program monitoring information on the ability of responsible agencies to perform data-gathering activities required to determine the effectiveness of internal and external programs and the extent to which they comply with related laws, regulations, and policies. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: There are legislative mandates prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets. Trade secrets will generally be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact level. Note that national security information and national security systems are outside the scope of this guideline. Otherwise, where the data being collected belongs to one of the information types described in this guideline, the confidentiality impact assigned the data and system is that of the highest impact information type collected. Unauthorized disclosure of program monitoring information can alert personnel associated with programs being monitored to the focus and implications of monitoring activities. Where a major programs or human safety is at stake, actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure of program monitoring information can pose a threat to human life or a loss of major assets. In such cases, the confidentiality impact is high. If the program monitoring information is moved to the public domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes Not Applicable (NA).</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>Although there are many circumstances in which serious adverse effects on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals can result to justify a moderate base confidentiality impact level for program monitoring information, in most Federal environments, unauthorized disclosure will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Consequently, for most systems, a low provisional confidentiality impact level is recommended for program monitoring information.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the program monitoring information. Although there may be time-sensitive program monitoring situations, more typically, disruption of access to program monitoring information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: There are a limited number of compliance monitoring operations for which temporary loss of availability is likely to significantly degrade mission capability, place the agency at a significant disadvantage, result in loss of major assets, or pose a threat to human life. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>The provisional availability impact level recommended for program monitoring information is low.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of program monitoring information can compromise the effectiveness of the monitoring program. Although there may be time-sensitive program monitoring situations, the integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The damage likely to be caused by unauthorized modification or destruction of program monitoring information may have consequent serious adverse effects on agency operations or public confidence in the agency.</integrity_explanation>
        <integrity_recommendation>There are some regulatory environments in which a high or moderate impact level is appropriate. For most compliance monitoring information, the recommended provisional integrity impact level is low. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: The consequences can be particularly serious if the destruction or modification of monitoring information invalidates evaluation results concerning major programs or concerning threats to human safety. The integrity impact resulting from unauthorized modification or deletion of program monitoring information depends in part on the nature of the laws or policies with which compliance is being determined and in part on the criticality of the processes being monitored. For example, in the case of safety regulations affecting manned space flight, the integrity impact level may be high.</integrity_recommendation>

        <title>Policy and Guidance Development</title>
        <description>Policy and Guidance Development involves the creation and dissemination of guidelines to assist in the interpretation and implementation of regulations. In most cases, the effect on public welfare of a loss of policy and guidance development mission capability can be expected to be delayed rather than immediate. As a result, the potential for consequent loss of human life or of major national assets is relatively low, since these most catastrophic consequences of impairment to mission capability can, in most cases, be corrected before they are fully realized. The recommended security categorization for the policy and guidance development information type is as follows:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-low</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of policy and guidance information on the ability of responsible agencies to create and disseminate guidelines to assist in the interpretation and implementation of regulations. The confidentiality impact of policy and guidance information is largely event-driven. Once a policy or guidance statement has been promulgated, most policy and guidance information is in the public domain. However, premature unauthorized disclosure of candidate policy and guidance material can result in disruption of (and inappropriate influence of special interests on) the policy development process. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The effects of loss of confidentiality of guidelines during the formative stage can result in attempts by affected entities and other interested parties to influence and/or impede the policy and guideline development process. Premature public release of formative policies and guidelines before internal coordination and review can result in unnecessary damage to public confidence in the agency. This is particularly likely where the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion. Delays can impair an agency’s mission, but loss of public confidence can do serious and persistent harm to an agency’s ability to effectively perform its mission. In such cases, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for policy and guidance development information is moderate. When the policy and guidance information is in the public domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes Not Applicable (NA).</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>Although there are cases in which unauthorized and premature disclosure of policy and guidance information can result in serious consequences for an agency, most of this information is intended to be available to the general public. Consequently, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for policy and guidance development information is low.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the policy and guidance development information. Though some policy and guidance information is time-critical, the policy and guidance development process is usually tolerant of delays.</availability_explanation>

        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Some policy and guidance information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications that contain policy and guidance development information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited. Public confidence consequences can be expected to be much more serious in cases of agencies that have national defense, intelligence, or information security missions. In such cases, the impact may be at least moderate.</integrity_explanation>

        <title> Public Comment Tracking</title>
        <description>Public Comment Tracking involves the activities of soliciting, maintaining, and responding to public comments regarding proposed regulations. Subject to exception conditions described below, the recommended security categorization for the public comment tracking information type is as follows:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-low</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of public comment tracking information on the ability of responsible agencies to solicit, maintain, and respond to public comments regarding proposed regulations. The effects of loss of confidentiality of information associated with the public comment process are unlikely to pose the threat of serious harm to agency assets, personnel or operations. In a few cases, the rationale for public comments can include information that is sensitive in terms of proprietary information sensitive Federal government information, or even national security information. However, such cases are exceptional and the information in question would be expected to be representative of information types covered elsewhere in this guideline.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for public comment tracking information is low.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the public comment tracking information. The effects of disruption of access to public comment tracking information or information systems can delay development of standards, guidelines, or regulations. The public comment tracking process is usually tolerant of delays. Permanent loss of comment information may disrupt some government operations by showing a lack of due diligence in response to comments.</availability_explanation>

The effects of loss of confidentiality of early drafts of regulations can result in attempts by affected entities and other affected parties to influence and/or impede the regulation development process. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Premature public release of draft regulations before internal coordination and review has been conducted can result in unnecessary criticism of the proposed regulation and even damage public confidence in the agency. In such cases, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for regulatory creation information is moderate. These consequences are particularly likely where the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some budget information of is classified national security information and is outside the scope of this guideline. The effects of loss of confidentiality of budget information or of early drafts of budgets can result in attempts by competing interests to influence and/or impede the regulation development process. The consequences to agency programs and even of the ability of an agency to perform its mission can be very serious. Premature public release of draft budgets before internal coordination and review has been conducted can result in unnecessary criticism of the proposed regulation and even damage public confidence in the agency. These consequences are particularly likely where the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion. Delays that result from confidentiality compromise can imperil specific agency programs, but loss of public confidence can do persistent harm to an agency’s ability to effectively perform its mission.

        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of enterprise architecture information on the ability of responsible agencies to describe the current state and define the target state and transition strategy for an organizations people, processes, and technology. The effects of loss of confidentiality of preliminary draft enterprise architecture plans can result in attempts by affected entities and other interested parties to influence and/or impede the policy and guideline development process. Premature public release of draft plans before internal coordination and review can result in unnecessary damage to public confidence in the agency. This is particularly likely where the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion. However, the consequence of loss of confidentiality of most enterprise architecture information is likely to do only limited harm to government assets, personnel, or missions. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some of the background information that supports development of Federal enterprise architecture can reveal sensitive vulnerabilities, capabilities, or methods of anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national security activities.13 Depending on the information in question, the confidentiality impact can be moderate, high, or involve national security information (outside the scope of this guideline). Also, some enterprise architecture plans of some Federal agencies are themselves national security information. Finally, important financial decisions and planning information may be included in this category of information.</confidentiality_explanation>

        <title>Debt Collection</title>
        <description>Debt Collection supports activities associated with the collection of money owed to the United States government from both foreign and domestic sources. The recommended security categorization for debt collection information is as follows:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-moderate</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of debt collection information on the ability of responsible agencies to properly and efficiently collect money owed to the United States government from both foreign and domestic sources. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of debt collection information are generally dependent on the identity of the debtor and of the nature and value of the debt being collected. Typically, unauthorized disclosure of debt collection information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where more sensitive information is involved, it will commonly be personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, information that is proprietary to a corporation or other organization, or information that is politically sensitive by a foreign government. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Such information will often be associated with debt collection processes. Where the amount of the debt is significant, and unauthorized knowledge might imperil successful collection, then the associated confidentiality impact assigned to debt collection information might be moderate (or even high in the case of extremely high dollar value cases).</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for debt collection information is moderate.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the debt collection information. Most Federal debt collection processes are tolerant of delays. Also, the consequences of temporary inability to access information concerning foreign or domestic debt will be minimal.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>The provisional availability impact level recommended for debt collection information is low.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Therefore, the consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of debt collection information depend on the type of property being managed and on the immediacy with which the information is expected to be used. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: If the modified or destroyed information is substantive financial data, there is a greater potential for harm to result from actions being taken based on incomplete or false information. This can have serious adverse effects on individual financial actions with consequent loss of revenue from, or other unanticipated consequences regarding the personal property under disposition. The severity of the consequences depends on the type of the debt and of the debtor but would be most likely be moderate.</integrity_explanation>

For example, there may be some circumstances when the unauthorized modification or destruction of user fee collection information is undertaken as part of a scheme to divert payments, conceal underpayment of failure to make payment of fees, or otherwise defraud the government. In addition, the consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of user fee collection information may depend on the urgency with which the information is needed or the immediacy with which the information is used. In most cases, it is unlikely that the information will be needed urgently or acted upon immediately. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications might have an adverse effect on agency operations, image and reputation. The integrity impact level assigned may be moderate.</integrity_explanation>

The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of Federal asset sales information are generally dependent on the nature and value of the property being disposed. Generally, Federal asset sales information is public. Most managed property would not be of sufficient individual value to occasion such an occurrence (bid rigging, etc.). Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where unauthorized knowledge regarding the property being disposed of might lead to unfair advantage (i.e., ability to accurately bid on an auction lot to the detriment of other bidders), then the associated confidentiality impact assigned to Federal asset sales information might be moderate. Such an instance might arise if a disruption of the proper procedures could reasonably cause an adverse effect on future operations of the responsible agency, or if the agency’s image, or individual reputations might be damaged.</confidentiality_explanation>

        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of Federal asset sale information is partially dependent on the type of property being managed and whether the data is time-critical. If the modified or destroyed information is substantive financial data, actions that are taken based on incomplete or false information could have serious adverse effects on individual financial actions. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, solicitations for bid, official notices of disposition, etc.) may adversely affect the operations, image or reputation of an agency. However, the damage to the management mission would usually be of more immediate concern. The severity of the consequent integrity impact depends on the nature of the property but would be most likely be moderate.</integrity_explanation>

        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of customer service information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide and manage the delivery of information and support to the government’s customers. Most customer service information is likely to be in the public domain and poses no confidentiality impact. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of customer service information will have at most a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some customer service information may include customer-provided information covered by the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Unauthorized disclosure of large volumes of information protected under the Privacy Act can be expected to have a serious to severe effect on public confidence in the agency.

Typically, the unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) will result in limited adverse affect on operations or public confidence in the agency and the damage to most missions would usually be limited. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: An increasing proportion of customer service activities are interactive. Consequently, there is a potential for customer actions being taken based on modified or incomplete information. Similarly, unauthorized modification or deletion of customer-supplied information can result in government mishandling of interactions with customers.

In general, unauthorized disclosure of much Congressional liaison information is likely to result in serious harm to agency assets and/or operations. If the Congressional liaison information is moved to the public domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes Not Applicable (NA). Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some Congressional liaison information used by Federal agencies (e.g., homeland security, law enforcement, defense, intelligence community) is very sensitive or even classified national security information. National security information is outside the scope of this guideline. The sensitivity level associated with the very sensitive information is high.</confidentiality_explanation>

        <title>Central Fiscal Operations</title>
        <description>Central Fiscal Operations includes the fiscal operations that the Department of Treasury performs on behalf of the Government.14 [Note: Tax-related functions are associated with the Taxation Management information type.] Impacts to some information and information systems associated with central fiscal operations may affect the security of the critical banking and finance infrastructure. In most cases, the effect on public welfare of a loss of central fiscal operations functionality can be expected to be delayed rather than immediate. The potential for consequent loss of human life or of major national assets is low. . The provisional security categorization recommended for the central fiscal operations information type is as follows:</description>

        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of central fiscal operations information on the fiscal operations that the Department of Treasury performs on behalf of the Government. The effects of loss of confidentiality can reasonably be expected to jeopardize relationships and administrative actions necessary to mission fulfillment and/or to seriously damage public confidence in the agency. For example, the unauthorized disclosure of investigative and enforcement information can have serious economic impact on both individual companies and the broader market place (e.g., short-term stock market perturbations). The consequences of such unauthorized disclosures may have a serious adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where the operations in question involve liaison with law enforcement or homeland security organizations, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure can imperil operations critical to the security of human life, critical infrastructure protection, ore the protection of key national assets. For those operations, the consequences to key financial infrastructure elements can be serious to severe. In such cases, the associated confidentiality impact level will be high.</confidentiality_explanation>

        <description>Central Property Management involves most of the operations of the General Services Administration. The following recommended provisional security categorization of central property management information is particularly subject to change where critical infrastructure elements or key national assets are involved:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-low</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of central property management information on the ability of the General Services Administration to acquire, provide, and centrally administer offices buildings, fleets, machinery, and other capital assets and consumable supplies used by the Federal government. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most central property management information are likely to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of information associated with very large procurements can result in fraud, waste, abuse, and/or legal proceedings that can have a serious to severe effect on Federal government assets and operations. Also, information associated with acquisition, maintenance, administration, and operation of many Federal government office buildings, transportation fleets, and operational facilities can be of material use to criminals seeking to gain access to Federal facilities to facilitate or perpetrate fraud, theft, or some other criminal enterprise. In this case, unauthorized disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. The consequent confidentiality impact would be at least moderate. Information associated with maintenance, administration, and operation of other Federal government facilities can be of material use to terrorists seeking to penetrate and/or commandeer such facilities as part of operations intended to harm critical infrastructures, key national assets, or people. Examples of more potentially damaging information include architectural, maintenance and administrative information that might permit either covert pedestrian or unimpeded vehicular access to government buildings (e.g., Congressional office buildings, FBI Headquarters, the National Archives, Smithsonian Institution buildings, dams, nuclear power plants, etc.). In such cases, the confidentiality impact level may be high. [Some information is classified as national security and is outside the scope of this guideline.] Anticipated or realized unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s central property management information by GSA could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the central property management infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked with acquiring and managing government facilities and supplies.</confidentiality_explanation>

The functions supported by most central property management information are tolerant of delays. Typically, the disruption of access to central property management information will have a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency response aspects of disaster management. In such cases, delays measured in hours can cost lives and major property damage. Consequently, the availability impact level associated with unauthorized modification or destruction of central property management information needed to respond to emergencies may be high.</availability_explanation>

In addition, the consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of central property management information usually depends on the urgency with which the information is needed or the immediacy with which the information is used. In most cases, it is unlikely that the information will be time-critical or acted upon immediately. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external publication of central property management information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect public confidence in the agency.

Central personnel management information includes human resources management and consulting services, education and leadership development services, and investigation services. The unauthorized disclosure of most central personnel management information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Very sensitive information is typically personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974.

        <title>Taxation Management</title>
        <description>Taxation Management includes activities associated with the implementation of the Internal Revenue Code and the collection of taxes in the United States and abroad. The recommended security categorization for the taxation management information type is as follows:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-moderate</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of taxation management information on the ability of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to enforce the Internal Revenue Code and to collect taxes in the United States and abroad. The IRS Guidebook for Information Sensitivity Analysis provides guidelines for identifying IRS Official Use Only (OUO) Information. Sensitive information is identified in the IRM as any information which if lost, stolen, (accessed), or altered without proper authorization may adversely affect Service operations. The IRM states that unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information may cause lawsuits against Service officials as well as the Service, unwanted notoriety for the Service, and public distrust of the Service’s ability to protect such information – all of which may result in an increase in noncompliance with tax laws. It notes that unauthorized release of information such as the name and address of an informant (in cases of tax evasion or fraud) may threaten a person’s life.17 Additionally, sensitive information is defined in Section 25.10 of the IRM as information that requires protection due to the risk or magnitude of loss that could result from inadvertent or deliberate disclosure of the information. Sensitive information includes information whose improper use could adversely affect the ability of the agency to accomplish its mission, proprietary information, records about individuals that require protection under the Privacy Act, and information not releasable under the Freedom of Information Act. The IRS OUO guideline notes that prevention of unauthorized disclosure of information revealing internal matters, the disclosure of which would risk circumvention of a legal requirement or agency rules and regulations has assumed an increasingly important role in homeland security. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or private IRS information can be expected to have a serious effect on both the welfare of individuals and public confidence in the government. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In cases where unauthorized disclosure of taxation information can impede anti-terrorism or other homeland security activities or endanger the lives of agents or informants, the confidentiality impact level is high.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for taxation management information is moderate.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the taxation management information. Taxation management processes are generally tolerant of limited delays. In most cases, disruption of access to taxation management information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on overall agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. However, even temporary loss of availability of taxation management information is likely to have an adverse effect on public confidence in the agency and on Federal government cash flow. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: While most cases will result in only limited consequences, repeated disruptions can have a serious adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. This can significantly degrade the taxation management mission capability. In such cases, the availability impact might be moderate. Loss of availability of significant amounts of taxation management information over long periods of time can do serious harm to Federal government operations. The economic ramifications would potentially be severe.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>The provisional availability impact level recommended for taxation management information is low.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In addition, the consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of taxation management information may depend on the urgency with which the information is needed or the immediacy with which the information is used. In most cases, it is unlikely that the information will be needed urgently or acted upon immediately. Also, the adverse effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of taxation management information on overall agency mission functions is expected to be limited. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: There is a potential for tax code enforcement, other law enforcement, or anti-terrorism actions being taken based on modified or incomplete information. Also, unauthorized modification or destruction of taxation management information may result in distribution of false and misleading information. Such events can be expected to adversely affect individuals, operations, and/or public confidence in the agency. This can significantly degrade the taxation management mission capability. In extreme cases (e.g., misidentification of an informant), the consequences can be life threatening. In such cases, a high integrity impact may exist.</integrity_explanation>

        <availability_recommendation>The provisional availability impact level recommended for personal identity and authentication information is moderate.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific purpose to which personal identity and authentication information is put; and not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. In the case of very large databases containing personal identity and authentication information relating to the general public, there is a significant probability that erroneous actions will be taken affecting benefits entitlements of or access to facilities by large numbers of individuals. In the case of benefits, this can result in at least short-term financial hardship for citizens. It can also be expected to result in very serious disruption of the agency operations due to large time and resource requirements for taking corrective actions. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In the case of smaller organizations, and where the information affected is limited to employees, there will still be an impact, but the consequences may justify only a low provisional impact rating. Where a data modification permits access to facilities (or ingress into the United States) by individuals to whom access should be prohibited, the integrity impact could be high.</integrity_explanation>

        <description>An additional management and support sub-function information type has been defined to address General Information as a catch-all information type that may not be defined by the FEA BRM. As such, agencies may find it necessary to identify additional information types not defined in the BRM and assign impact levels to those types. Agency personnel may uniquely identify information types using a FIPS 199 process to identify information not contained neatly in the FEA BRM. Not all of these information types are likely to have the same impact levels.

        <title>Facilities, Fleet, and Equipment Management</title>
        <description>Facilities, Fleet, and Equipment management involves the maintenance, administration, certification, and operation of office buildings, fleets, machinery, and other capital assets considered as possessions of the Federal government. Impacts to some information and information systems associated with facilities, fleet, and equipment management may affect the security of some key national assets (e.g., nuclear power plants, dams, and other government facilities). The following recommended provisional categorization of the facilities, fleet, and equipment management information type is particularly subject to change where critical infrastructure elements or key national assets are involved:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-low</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of facilities, fleet, and equipment management information on the ability of responsible agencies to maintain, administer, and operate offices buildings, fleets, machinery, and other capital assets of the Federal government. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most facilities, fleet, and equipment management information are likely to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Information associated with maintenance, administration, and operation of many Federal government office buildings, transportation fleets, and operational facilities can be of material use to criminals seeking to gain access to Federal facilities in order to facilitate or perpetrate fraud, theft, or some other criminal enterprise (e.g., extract inmates from Federal detention facilities). In this case, unauthorized disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. The consequent confidentiality impact would be at least moderate. Information associated with maintenance, administration, and operation of other Federal government office buildings, transportation fleets, and operational facilities can be of material use to terrorists seeking to penetrate and/or commandeer such facilities as part of operations intended to harm critical infrastructures, key national assets, or people. Examples of this information include information that reveals specific measures respecting limiting access to and operation of government aircraft, maintenance and administrative information that might permit either covert pedestrian or unimpeded vehicular access to government buildings (e.g., Congressional office buildings, FBI Headquarters, the National Archives, Smithsonian Institution buildings, dams, nuclear power plants, etc.), and schedules/itineraries of government surface transportation fleets (e.g., for transport of executive personnel or hazardous materials). In these cases, the confidentiality impact must be considered to be high. [Some information regarding transportation and storage of nuclear materials is classified as national security related and is outside the scope of this guideline. Other information, such as Nuclear Regulatory Commission “SAFEGUARDS” information is not national security information, but must have a high confidentiality impact level.] Anticipated or realized unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s facilities, fleet, and equipment management information by another agency could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the facilities, fleet, and equipment management infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked with facilities, fleet, and/or equipment management.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for facilities, fleet, and equipment management information is low.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the facilities, fleet, and equipment management information. Functions supported by most facilities, fleet, and equipment management information are tolerant of delays. Typically, disruption of access to facilities, fleet, and equipment management information has a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency response aspects of disaster management or leadership protection. In such cases, delays measured in seconds can cost lives and major property damage. Consequently, the availability impact level associated with unauthorized modification or destruction of facilities, fleet, and equipment management information needed to respond to emergencies will be high.</availability_explanation>

The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most help desk service information are likely to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Information associated with service center responses can provide useful information to adversaries seeking to penetrate Federal systems.

        <title>Security Management</title>
        <description>Security Management involves the physical protection of an organization’s personnel, assets, and facilities (including security clearance management). Impacts to some information and information systems associated with security management may affect the security of some critical infrastructure elements and key national assets (e.g., nuclear power plants, dams, and other government facilities). Impact levels associated with security information directly relate to the potential threat to human life associated with the asset(s) being protected (e.g., consequences to the public of terrorist access to dams or nuclear power plants). The following recommended categorization of the security management information type is subject to change where critical infrastructure elements or key national assets are involved:</description>

        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-moderate</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of security management information on the ability of responsible organizations to physically protect their personnel, assets, and facilities. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most security management information depend on the likelihood that the information might jeopardize the physical security of an organization’s assets and the value, and potential for damage of the assets being protected. Information associated with the physical security of many Federal government office buildings, transportation fleets, and operational facilities can be of material use to criminals seeking to gain access to Federal facilities in order to perpetrate a major crime (e.g., extraction of inmates from Federal detention facilities, theft of commodities market projections, access to information associated with a felony criminal investigation or prosecution, theft of blank license issuing facilities and/or materials, access to competition-sensitive information associated with major procurements, undetected access to national archives or museum properties, access to currency printing facilities or materials, theft of major currency or bullion storage facilities). In such cases, unauthorized disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s security management information by another agency could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the security management infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked with physical protection of Federal facilities. The consequences of physical protection failures at most Federal facilities are more likely to result in serious21 adverse effects. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Information associated with security management at other Federal government office buildings, transportation fleets, and operational facilities can be of material use to terrorists seeking to penetrate and/or commandeer such facilities as part of operations intended to harm critical infrastructures, key national assets, or people. Examples of more potentially damaging information includes information that reveals specific measures for protecting government aircraft, information that might permit access that creates an opportunity to bomb a government building (e.g., Congressional office buildings, FBI Headquarters, the National Archives, Smithsonian Institution buildings, dams, nuclear power plants, etc.), and leadership protection details that could result in assassination opportunities. In these cases, the confidentiality impact must be high. Unauthorized disclosure of security management information that can be reasonably expected to pose a serious threat to human life (including those of security guards) must also be assigned a high confidentiality impact. [Security management information associated with some Federal government assets is classified. The classified information is national security related and is outside the scope of this guideline.] Other security management information, such as that affecting Nuclear Regulatory Commission “SAFEGUARDS” or Internal Revenue Service “Limited For Official Use Only” information is not national security information, but must be treated as having high confidentiality impact.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The confidentiality impact level recommended for most security management information is moderate.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the security management information. Functions supported by most security management information are tolerant of delays. Typically, disruption of access to security management information will have a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include alarm and alert communications and interconnections for security management systems and automated control systems that support security management processes (e.g., door and gate operations in buildings to which access is limited such as detention facilities and many Federal office buildings For these exceptions, the data is time-critical.

Generally, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of the majority of travel information will result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of employee identification information coupled with credit information (e.g., name, social security number, credit card number) can result in moderate to serious consequences for individuals and local organizations. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Unauthorized disclosure of information concerning carrier/provider contract negotiations can have significant financial or legal consequences and put an agency at a serious disadvantage.

        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of financial reporting information on an agency’s ability to provide financial information and reporting and analysis of financial transactions. Typically, the unauthorized disclosure of financial reporting information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of financial reporting information for programs that process high-impact information can give adversaries damaging insights into details of agency plans, priorities, and operations. In relatively rare cases, actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure of financial reporting details pose a threat to human life or a loss of major assets, so the confidentiality impact is high.</confidentiality_explanation>

        <title>Funds Control</title>
        <description>Funds Control includes the management of the Federal budget process including the development of plans and programs, budgets, and performance outputs as well as financing Federal programs and operations through appropriation and apportionment of direct and reimbursable spending authority, fund transfers, investments and other financing mechanisms. Funds control management includes the establishment of a system for ensuring an organization does not obligate or disburse funds in excess of those appropriated or authorized. The recommended security categorization for the funds control information type is as follows:</description>

        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of funds control information on the ability of responsible agencies to develop plans and programs, budgets, and performance outputs and outcomes; and to finance Federal programs and operations through appropriation and apportionment of direct and reimbursable spending authority, fund transfers, investments and other financing mechanisms. In general, unauthorized disclosure of funds control information, particularly of budget allocations for specific programs or program elements, can be seriously detrimental to government interests in procurement processes. In many instances, such unauthorized disclosure is prohibited by executive order or by law (e.g., Federal Acquisition Regulation). Premature release of draft funds control information can yield advantages to competing interests and seriously endanger agency operations – or even agency mission. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of funds control information for programs that process classified or high-impact information can give adversaries damaging insights into details of agency plans, priorities, and operations. (Classified programs and systems are outside the scope of this guideline.) In rare cases, actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure of funds control details can pose a threat to human life or a loss of major assets, so the confidentiality impact would be high.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>While, in many cases, unauthorized disclosure of funds control information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals, the potential for serious harm is such that the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for funds control information is moderate.</confidentiality_recommendation>

Unauthorized disclosure of accounting information for programs that process classified or high-impact information can give adversaries damaging insights into details of agency plans, priorities, and operations. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of accounting information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In relatively rare cases, actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure of accounting details can pose a threat to human life or a loss of major assets, so the confidentiality impact would be high. In some cases, unauthorized disclosure of accounting information can violate proprietary information or other non-disclosure agreements. In such cases, the government may suffer not only a loss of public confidence, but may become vulnerable to legal actions. Where sensitive or proprietary information is involved, the impact of unauthorized disclosure is likely to be moderate.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Payment information typically includes information needed for electronic payments such as bank account numbers. Unauthorized access to this type of information could result in significant financial loss for both the Federal government and its payees. Where payment activities are part of an agency’s service delivery mission (e.g., payment of benefits), Privacy Act information and other information subject to statutory or regulatory dissemination controls must appear in the payment vehicles (e.g., name and social security number on check records). (The provisional impact levels for personnel information are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication, Income, Representative Payee, and Entitlement Event information types.)

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where more sensitive information is involved, it will probably be personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. In a few cases (e.g., where some employees are potential targets for retaliation by criminal elements or targets of foreign intelligence organizations), unauthorized disclosure of some compensation management information (e.g., name, address, title, organization, dependents’ information) can have life-threatening consequences and has a high confidentiality impact level.</confidentiality_explanation>

The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most goods acquisition information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of information associated with large procurements can result in fraud, waste, abuse, and/or legal proceedings that can have a serious to severe effect on Federal government assets and operations. Also, information associated with acquisition of many Federal government facilities can be useful to criminals seeking to gain access to those facilities. In these cases, unauthorized disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. The consequent confidentiality impact would range from moderate to high. Also, unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s goods acquisition information by another agency could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the goods acquisition infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked with acquisition of government facilities and supplies. Additionally, some procurement information associated with proposals is proprietary. In the case of competitive procurements, much information associated with unsuccessful bids remains proprietary following award of the contract (e.g., pricing information). Unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information can have serious consequences for agencies and have at least a moderate confidentiality impact level. Some procurement information is classified.

        <title>Services Acquisition</title>
        <description>Services acquisition involves the oversight and/or management of contractors and service providers from the private sector. The recommended security categorization for the services acquisition information type is as follows:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-low</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of services acquisition information on the ability of agencies to oversee and/or manage contractors and service providers from the private sector. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most services acquisition information are likely to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of information associated with very large procurements can result in fraud, waste, abuse, and/or legal proceedings that can have a serious effect on Federal government assets and operations. Also, information associated with acquisition of some services (e.g., security or protection services) can be of material use to criminals seeking to gain access to Federal facilities or information in order to facilitate or perpetrate sabotage, murder, fraud, theft, or other criminal enterprises. In these cases, unauthorized disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, and/or individuals. The consequent confidentiality impact will range from moderate to high. Additionally, some procurement information associated with proposals is proprietary. In the case of competitive procurements, much information associated with unsuccessful bids remains proprietary following award of the contract (e.g., pricing information). Unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information can have serious consequences for agencies and have at least a moderate confidentiality impact level. Some services procurement information is classified. The classified information is national security related and is outside the scope of this guideline.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for most services acquisition information is low.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to services acquisition information. Functions and processes supported by most services acquisition information are tolerant of delays i.e., the data supporting the functions/processes are not time-critical. In most cases, disruption of access to services procurement information can be expected to have a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>The provisional availability impact level recommended for services acquisition information is low.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of services acquisition information usually depends on the urgency with which the information is needed or the immediacy with which the information is used. In most cases, the information will not be needed urgently or acted upon immediately. Also, unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external publication of services acquisition information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect public confidence in the agency. However, damage to the mission would usually be limited. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction of information relating to procurement actions (particularly proposal information) can result in serious disruption of procurement processes and loss of availability of services that can be important or even critical to agency operations. In such cases, the integrity impact level can be moderate or even high.</integrity_explanation>

        <title>IT Infrastructure Maintenance</title>
        <description>IT infrastructure maintenance involves the planning, design, implementation, and maintenance of an IT Infrastructure to effectively support automated needs (i.e. operating systems, applications software, platforms, networks, servers, printers, etc.). IT infrastructure maintenance also includes information systems configuration and security policy enforcement information. This information includes password files, network access rules and implementing files and/or switch setting, hardware and software configuration settings, and documentation that may affect access to the information system’s data, programs, and/or processes. The impact levels associated with IT infrastructure maintenance information are primarily a function of the information processed in and through that infrastructure. The IT Maintenance Information type represents a complex set of data elements that are used to secure the design, implementation, and maintenance of systems and networks. The security of each of these data elements is dependent on the security of the other data elements. Security compromise of one data element type will propagate to others. The recommended security categorization for the IT infrastructure maintenance information type is as follows:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-low</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of IT infrastructure maintenance information on the ability of responsible agencies to plan, design, implement, and maintain an IT Infrastructure to effectively support automated needs (i.e. operating systems, applications software, platforms, networks, servers, printers, etc.). [See also Appendices C.3.5.5, IT Security Information and C.3.5.7, Information Management Information.] IT infrastructure maintenance also includes information systems configuration and security policy enforcement information. Unauthorized disclosure of some IT infrastructure maintenance information can lead to confidentiality compromise of information processed by the system (e.g., password files, file access tables, cryptographic keying information, network access rules, and hardware and software configuration settings, and documentation that may affect access to the information system’s data, programs, and/or processes). As a result, the confidentiality impact associated with this information is that of the highest impact information processed by the system. Also, a higher confidentiality impact may be associated with information in aggregate than is associated with any single element of information.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>Particularly in the case of passwords and cryptographic keys, the provisional impact level recommended for IT infrastructure maintenance information depends on the sensitivity and criticality of system information and processes. Although an individual organization’s IT infrastructure maintenance information type base may include data elements that will require a higher rating, the recommended provisional impact is low.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to IT infrastructure maintenance information. Functions and processes supported by most IT infrastructure maintenance information are not time-critical. Also, disruption of access will have a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency response aspects of disaster management or other high load and time critical functions (e.g., some systems that support air traffic control functions). The effects of disruption of access to IT infrastructure maintenance information or information systems may be to deny mission-critical IT resources to all affected organizations. The availability impact level associated with denial-of-service to IT infrastructure maintenance information needed to respond to emergencies or critical to public safety can be high.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>The provisional availability impact level recommended for IT infrastructure maintenance information is low.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of IT infrastructure maintenance information usually depends on the urgency with which the data processed in the IT infrastructure is needed or the time-critical nature of the data. In most cases, it is unlikely that the information will be needed urgently or acted upon immediately. In most cases, the consequences of unauthorized modification of IT infrastructure maintenance information will result in limited damage to agency operations or assets. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Exceptions may include incorrect information used for emergency response aspects of disaster management, criminal apprehension, air traffic control or other time-critical missions. In such cases, a moderate or high integrity impact level might be considered.</integrity_explanation>

When the data being retained belongs to one of the information types described in this guideline, the confidentiality impact assigned the data and system is at least that of the highest impact information type collected. Typically, the unauthorized disclosure of most business management information retained will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. National security information and national security systems are outside the scope of this guideline. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where more sensitive information is involved, it will most commonly be personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 or information that is proprietary to a corporation or other organization. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Such information will often be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact level. Where any of the information to be collected can reasonably be expected to have a high confidentiality impact level, then the record retention system must be assigned a high confidentiality impact level.

The consequences of unauthorized disclosure depend largely on the content and use of the monitoring information gathered, retained, and reported. The unauthorized disclosure of system and network monitoring containing architectural information, vulnerabilities, and availability information may have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where the system and network monitoring information collected can be expected to have a high confidentiality impact level, then the system and network monitoring information must be assigned a high confidentiality impact level. When the system and network monitoring data being collected supports information types described in this guideline, agency personnel should consider a confidentiality impact assignment of the highest impact information type processed by the system.

        <description>The BRM provided in the FEA Consolidated Reference Model Document, Version 2.3, October 2007 specifies Information Sharing as relating to any method or function, for a given business area, facilitating: data being received in a usable medium by one or more departments or agencies as provided by a separate department or agency or other entity; and data being provided, disseminated or otherwise made available or accessible by one department or agency for use by one or more separate departments or agencies, or other entities, as appropriate. Since Information Sharing, as a function, is receiving and disseminating data [other information types] from business areas already identified, this BRM information type will not require its own impact assessment. Therefore, agency personnel should identify the information sharing information type as a pure resource management support activity for the evaluated information system. With the information sharing information type identified, agency personnel can track the flow of information to interfacing systems. The recommended security categorization for the information sharing information type is as follows:</description>

        <title>Border and Transportation Security</title>
        <description>Border and Transportation Security includes facilitating or deterring entry and exit of people, goods, and conveyances at and between U.S. ports of entry, as well as ensuring the security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States. Border control involves enforcing the laws regulating the admission of foreign-born persons (i.e., aliens) to the United States. This includes patrolling and monitoring borders and deportation of illegal aliens. Some border control information is also associated with other mission information types (e.g., criminal apprehension, and criminal investigation and surveillance information). In such cases, the impact levels of the associated mission information may determine impact levels associated with border control information. Some aspects of ensuring security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States are also covered under the information types associated with the transportation mission. In some cases the border control information may be classified. Any classified information is treated under separate rules established for national security information. The recommended categorization for unclassified border and transportation security information follows:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-moderate</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-moderate</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-moderate</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of border control information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce laws regulating the admission of foreign-born persons (i.e., aliens) to the United States. Generally, the effects of unauthorized disclosure of border control information are usually confined to a single geographic region, immigration case, or deportation case. Even so, unauthorized disclosure may have a serious adverse effect on mission functions, cause significant degradation in mission capability, or place the agency at a significant disadvantage with respect to its border control responsibilities. Particularly in the case of immigration, naturalization, and deportation activities, unauthorized disclosure of information can violate privacy policies. Such unauthorized disclosures can have a serious effect on public confidence in the agency. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where border control information is also associated with other mission information types (e.g., criminal apprehension, and criminal investigation and surveillance information), the confidentiality impact level associated with the information may be high. Where unauthorized disclosure of border control information may put the physical safety of personnel into serious jeopardy, the confidentiality impact level associated with the information may be high. Unauthorized disclosure of confidentiality of information associated with ensuring security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States can result in facilitation of terrorist activities that endanger human life. In some cases, the consequent threat to critical infrastructures, key national assets, and human life can be catastrophic. Consequently, the confidentiality impact level associated with information associated with ensuring security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States is normally high</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for most border control information is moderate.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to border control information. Functions and processes supported by most border control information are not time-critical. Also, disruption of access will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: There may be time critical cases, for example, information regarding transport of illegal aliens or information about a physical threat posed by aliens that border control personnel have been assigned to interdict. In such cased, the availability impact will be high. The consequences of disruption of access to information or information systems associated with ensuring security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States may be severe. Also, anti-terrorism missions are not reliably tolerant of delays. The availability impact level for information systems that ensure the security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States is high.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>Except for such time-critical cases, cases where impact is driven by information shared with associated missions (e.g., anti-terrorism), the provisional availability impact level recommended for border control information is normally moderate.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of information can be very serious if the information is critical to tactical operations. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction of information associated with ensuring security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States may seriously affect mission operations or result in the loss of human life. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting anti-terrorism information may adversely affect mission operations in a manner that results in unacceptable damage to critical infrastructures and/or key national assets or loss of key national assets and/or human life. Consequently, the integrity impact level associated with information that ensures the security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States is high.</integrity_explanation>
        <integrity_recommendation>The provisional integrity impact level recommended for border control information is moderate.</integrity_recommendation>

        <title>Key Asset and Critical Infrastructure Protection</title>
        <description>Key Asset and Critical Infrastructure Protection involves assessing key asset and critical infrastructure vulnerabilities and taking direct action to mitigate vulnerabilities, enhance security, and ensure continuity and necessary redundancy in government operations and personnel. The Critical Infrastructure Information Protection Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 131-134) places specific controls on the dissemination of critical infrastructure information (see Volume I, 3.5.2.3). Under the provisions of Executive Order 13292, some anti-terrorism information is subject to security classification. National security information is outside the scope of this guideline. The recommended categorization for unclassified anti-terrorism information follows:</description>

        <title>Catastrophic Defense</title>
        <description>Catastrophic Defense involves the development of technological countermeasures (chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear [CBRN]) to terrorist threats, conducting laboratory testing on new and promising devices, and conducting basic and applied science that can lead to the development of countermeasures. Under the provisions of Executive Order 13292, some anti-terrorism information is subject to security classification. National security information is outside the scope of this guideline.

        <title>Executive Functions of the Executive Office of the President</title>
        <description>Executive Functions involve the Executive Office of the President (EOP). Subject to exception conditions described below, the recommended provisional security categorization for the executive information type is as follows:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-high</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-high</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-moderate</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level associated with the executive information type is associated with functions of the Executive Office of the President (EOP). The effects of loss of confidentiality of policies and guidance during the formative stage can result in attempts by affected entities and other interested parties to influence and/or impede the policy and guidance development process. Premature public release of formative policies and guidance before internal coordination and review can result in unnecessary damage to public confidence in the EOP. These consequences may occur when the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion. Most of the information processed in and by the EOP is classified national security information and is outside the scope of this guideline. Other information processed by the EOP is extremely sensitive and applicable to homeland security and law enforcement. The unauthorized disclosure of this extremely sensitive information can seriously imperil human life, key national assets, and critical infrastructures.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>Based on the catastrophic harm that can be suffered by the nation due to unauthorized disclosure of executive information the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for executive functions information is high.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the executive information. National defense and critical infrastructure protection aspects of EOP functions are not generally tolerant of delays. Excessive recovery delays can result in loss of coordination of critical defense and public welfare processes.</availability_explanation>

        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications that contain EOP information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect public confidence in the government. In the case of the EOP, the impact of such a loss of public confidence may be at least moderate.</integrity_explanation>

        <title>Disaster Monitoring and Prediction</title>
        <description>Disaster monitoring and prediction involves the actions taken to predict when and where a disaster may take place and communicate that information to affected parties. [Some disaster management information occurs in humanitarian aid systems under the International Affairs and Commerce line of business (e.g., State Department disaster preparedness and planning).] The recommended provisional categorization of the disaster monitoring and protection information type follows:</description>

        <availability>fips-199-high</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-high</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of disaster monitoring and prediction information on the ability of responsible agencies to predict when and where a disaster may take place and communicate that information to affected parties. The purpose of disaster monitoring and prediction activities is generally to disseminate information. Sharing of raw information by a diverse group of analysts often improves the quality of predictive analysis. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of some disaster monitoring and prediction information may include public panic or other responses that jeopardize public safety, disaster prevention, emergency response, disaster repair, or restoration missions. For example, attempts of large populations to evacuate in an endangered area before necessary preparations are made for evacuation routes can result in a clogging of the routes and failure to evacuate large parts of the population in time to save them from a life-threatening event. Most of the disaster monitoring and prediction information is critical in terms of potential loss of human life and major property damage. The unauthorized release of this information may interfere with disaster prevention or emergency response missions. The confidentiality impact level recommended for the information cited in the example can be moderate or high. The unauthorized disclosure of disaster monitoring and prediction information to terrorists may reveal weak or sensitive points to target, the most effective technique(s use in attacking a target, and information regarding the status, intent, and plans of our adversaries. Where unauthorized disclosure of disaster monitoring and prediction information is expected to be of direct use to terrorists, the confidentiality impact level is recommended to be high.</confidentiality_explanation>

Generally, missions supported by disaster monitoring and prediction information are not reliably tolerant of delays. Delays may cost lives and irreplaceable property, e.g., degradation in mission capability and resultant catastrophic consequences for critical infrastructures, key national assets, and/or human life. For example, a loss of availability of information that prevents timely and accurate dissemination of tsunami and earthquake predictions can have life-threatening consequences.</availability_explanation>

These actions include providing mobile telecommunications, operational support, power generation, search and rescue, and medical life saving actions. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of emergency response information will usually have little or no adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In cases where an attack is underway, unauthorized disclosure of emergency response information can provide information that might permit terrorists or other adversaries to target emergency response assets, thus jeopardizing emergency response resources and missions and public safety. Given the criticality that much emergency response information has in terms of potential loss of human life and major property damage, where unauthorized release of information can reasonably be expected to facilitate interference with emergency response missions, the confidentiality impact level may be moderate or high.

        <description>Foreign Affairs refers to those activities associated with the implementation of foreign policy and diplomatic relations, including the operation of embassies, consulates, and other posts; ongoing membership in international organizations; the development of cooperative frameworks to improve relations with other Nations; and the development of treaties and agreements. Conflict resolution involves the mitigation and prevention of disputes stemming from inter and intra-state disagreements. Some conflict resolution information is subject to security classification. This classified information is treated under separate rules established for national security information and is outside the scope of this guideline. Treaties and agreements involves the negotiation and implementation of accords with foreign governments and organizations in efforts related to arms reduction and regulation, trade matters, criminal investigations and extraditions, and other various types of foreign policy. When treaties and agreements information affects intelligence gathering and/or law enforcement cooperation, impacts to such information and the information systems that process and store the information could result in negative impacts on protection of a broad range of critical infrastructures and key national assets. Some information associated with treaties and agreements is subject to security classification. This classified information is treated under separate rules established for national security information. The recommended categorization for unclassified foreign affairs information follows:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-high</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-moderate</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-high</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of conflict resolution information on the ability of responsible agencies to mitigate and prevent disputes stemming from inter and intra-state disagreements. Unauthorized disclosure of conflict resolution information can reasonably be expected to jeopardize fulfillment of conflict resolution missions. This is particularly true of premature release of resolution factors, personnel profiles, and proposed solutions to adversaries. Some information that has supported a conflict resolution process may undo the results of successful conflict resolution processes. The loss of public confidence in the agency may cause a catastrophic adverse effect on an agency’s mission capability. Where information includes candid opinions of agency personnel, or involvement of agency personnel in specific prior activities, the effectiveness of those personnel for many future agency missions may be permanently impaired. The consequences of failed conflict resolution activities may pose threats to human life and major property assets The level of confidentiality impact assigned to treaties and agreements information is determined by the ability of responsible agencies to negotiate and implement accords with foreign governments and organizations in efforts related to arms reduction and regulation, trade matters, criminal investigations and extraditions, and other types of foreign policy. Unauthorized disclosure of information associated with treaties and agreements can reasonably be expected to prevent successful negotiation and/or ratification of treaties and agreements. This is particularly true of prematurely released resolution factors, personality assessments, and proposed solutions to adversaries. Some information that has supported a treaty or other international agreement process may undo the results of a successfully completed treaty or agreement. The subsequent threat to public confidence in the agency can cause a catastrophic adverse effect on an agency’s mission capability. When the disclosed information includes candid opinions of agency personnel, or background information on agency personnel, the effectiveness of those personnel for future agency missions may be permanently impaired. The consequences of failure to successfully conclude treaties and other international agreements often pose threats to human life and major property assets.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for foreign affairs information is high.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to foreign affairs information. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Diplomatic missions are often tolerant of delays. Therefore, the availability impact level assigned to information associated with treaties and agreements that are associated with diplomatic missions is low. Where this is not the case, the availability impact for foreign affairs information associated with treaties and agreements may be high.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>The provisional availability impact level recommended for foreign affairs information is moderate.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of conflict resolution information depend on whether the information is time-critical. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of information associated with treaties and agreements also depend on the time-critical nature of the information. The unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited. The unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting conflict resolution information may adversely affect mission operations in a manner that results in unacceptable consequences such as loss of human life and/or major property assets. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of information can be very serious if the modification is to time-critical operational information.</integrity_explanation>

        <title>International Development and Humanitarian Aid</title>
        <description>International Development and Humanitarian Aid refers to those activities related to the implementation of development and humanitarian assistance programs to developing and transitioning countries throughout the world. Development and aid may include technical assistance (the transfer of knowledge and expertise), and the delivery of equipment, commodities and humanitarian assistance including food aid. In some cases, international development and humanitarian aid information is subject to security classification. This classified information is treated under separate rules established for national security information. The recommended categorization for unclassified international development and humanitarian aid information follows:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-moderate</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of international development and humanitarian aid information on the ability of responsible agencies to execute programs relating to debt relief, foreign investments, poverty alleviation and food relief, foreign market expansion, and donations, as well as the establishment of policies and procedures to facilitate economic development. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The unauthorized disclosure of international development and humanitarian aid information may not directly jeopardize foreign socio-economic and political development missions. However, the premature disclosure of this information may adversely affect agency credibility or give unfair competitive advantages to some candidates for mission support activities. These secondary effects may have a negative effect on the intended beneficiaries and can result, in extreme cases, in threats to human life, major assets, or the ability of the agency to perform future missions. Some information that has supported an international development and humanitarian aid process can even undo the results of previously completed foreign socio-economic and political development processes. Where there is a possibility of catastrophic consequences such as threats to human life and major property assets, a high confidentiality impact level must be assigned.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for international development and humanitarian aid information is moderate.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to international development and humanitarian aid information. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Generally, international development and humanitarian aid missions are tolerant of delays.

        <title>Global Trade</title>
        <description>Global Trade refers to those activities the Federal Government undertakes to advance worldwide economic prosperity by increasing trade through the opening of overseas markets and freeing the flow of goods, services, and capital. Trade encompasses all activities associated with the importing and exporting of goods to and from the United States. This includes goods declaration, fee payments, and delivery/shipment authorization. Export promotion involves the development of opportunities for the expansion of U.S. exports. Merchandise inspection includes the verification of goods and merchandise as well as the surveillance, interdiction, and investigation of imports/exports in violation of various Customs laws. Tariffs/quotas monitoring refers to the monitoring and modification of the schedules of items imported and exported to and from the United States. The recommended categorization for the global trade information type follows:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-high</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-high</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-high</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of export promotion information on the ability of responsible agencies to advance worldwide economic prosperity by increasing trade through the opening of overseas markets and freeing the flow of goods, services, and capital. Also, the confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of merchandise inspection information on the ability of responsible agencies to accurately determine, report, and record the discovered status of imported or exported merchandise as it bears on violations of various Customs laws. Generally, the unauthorized disclosure of merchandise inspection information will not jeopardize the completion of other merchandise inspection missions, as shipment status is generally information of public record. The confidentiality impact level is also the effect of unauthorized disclosure of tariffs/quotas monitoring information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce various Customs laws, and preserve statistical data concerning the historical compliance with such laws. Typically, the unauthorized disclosure of tariffs/quotas monitoring information will not jeopardize the completion of other tariffs/quotas monitoring missions because the information is publicly available. Unauthorized disclosure of information that has supported an export promotion process may undo the results of successful export promotion processes. The consequent threat to agency image or reputations can cause a catastrophic adverse effect on an agency’s mission capability. Consequently, the general confidentiality impact level associated with export promotion information is high. Some information that has supported a tariffs/quotas monitoring process might be of higher sensitivity, such as intelligence information36 that might point to a dumping situation. The unauthorized disclosure of this information might jeopardize the success of future tariffs/quotas monitoring processes. Consequently, the confidentiality impact level associated with tariffs/quotas monitoring information is high. Intelligence information is included in national security systems. National security information and national security systems are outside the scope of this guideline. Some information that has supported a merchandise inspection process might be of higher sensitivity. The unauthorized disclosure of this information might jeopardize the success of future merchandise inspection processes. The consequent threat to agency image or reputations may cause a serious adverse effect on an agency’s mission capability. Consequently, the general confidentiality impact level associated with merchandise inspection information is high.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for global trade information is high.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to global trade information. Export promotion and merchandise inspection missions are generally tolerant of significant delays. If the export promotion and merchandise inspection information are time-critical, the availability impact may be high. This would be the case where such an occurrence could result in significant financial consequences as a result of uncertainty regarding the status of an imported or exported shipment. Tariffs/quotas monitoring missions are also tolerant of significant delays. Typically, this information is used in high level policy and strategic analysis, and denial of access might cause an inconvenience but no significant mission impact. However, the availability impact associated with tariffs/quotas monitoring information may be high, if denial of access could result in serious damage to the image or reputation of an agency resulting from uncertainty regarding the compliance statistics of a major sovereign trade partner.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>he provisional availability impact level recommended for global trade information is high.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of global trade information depends on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting export promotion information may adversely affect mission operations and result in potentially serious economic repercussions. Trade agreements that have been implemented are generally matters of public record. Therefore, the specific negotiated terms, etc., must be accurately recorded. The modification of merchandise inspection information may result in significant financial consequences to an importer or exporter whose shipment is in question and may adversely affect mission operations and result in potentially serious economic repercussions. The results of completed inspections are matters of public record and must be accurately recorded. For tariffs/quotas monitoring information, the requirement for adequate means to detect data corruption is high. This information is used in policy and strategic analysis, and the accuracy of this statistical information is critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting tariffs/quotas monitoring information may adversely affect mission operations and result in potentially catastrophic economic repercussions.</integrity_explanation>

        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of water resource management information on the ability of responsible agencies to promote the effective use and management of the nation’s water resources. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most water resource management information would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: There may be some cases for which moderate confidentiality impact is associated with unauthorized disclosure of business/industry development. For example, unauthorized disclosure of details of current agency water resource management activities and plans may focus opposition and/or give an unfair advantage to competing interests. Consistent premature disclosure of agency plans may cause significant degradation in mission capability.</confidentiality_explanation>

The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most conservation, marine, and land management information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: There may be some cases for which moderate confidentiality impact is associated with unauthorized disclosure of private or proprietary information associated with use of federally owned/controlled lands for commercial use (mineral mining, grazing, forestry, fishing, etc.). Additionally, unauthorized disclosure of details of current agency conservation, marine, and land management activities and plans may focus opposition and/or give an unfair advantage to competing interests. Consistent premature disclosure of agency plans may cause significant degradation in mission capability. Also, conservation, marine, and land management include enforcement functions (e.g., the policing of marine fisheries). Confidentiality impacts associated with criminal apprehension, criminal investigation and surveillance, citizen protection, and property protection may cause the confidentiality impact of enforcement-related information to be moderate or high.</confidentiality_explanation>

The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most recreational resource management and tourism information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Recreational resource management and tourism include enforcement functions (e.g., protective and enforcement functions of the National Park Service). Confidentiality impacts associated with criminal apprehension, criminal investigation and surveillance, citizen protection, and property protection may cause the confidentiality impact of enforcement-related information to be moderate or high. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of property and tourist protection information can be particularly severe in the case of protection of national monuments and icons.</confidentiality_explanation>

        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to recreational resource management and tourism information. Generally, missions supported by recreational resource management and tourism information are tolerant of delays. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Recreational resource management and tourism include enforcement functions (e.g., protective and enforcement functions of the National Park Service). Availability impacts associated with criminal apprehension, criminal investigation and surveillance, citizen protection, and property protection may cause the confidentiality impact of enforcement-related information to be moderate or high. There may also be time-critical cases associated with protection of people and key national assets from natural disasters (such as fires, unexpected blizzards, or volcanic eruptions). In such cased, the availability impact may be high. Except for time-critical information, the availability impact level recommended for protection-related information is typically moderate.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>Most recreational resource management and tourism information is routine in nature (not time-critical).

In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of agricultural innovation and service information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, unauthorized disclosure of preliminary findings or policies under consideration regarding proposed agricultural products may result in domestic or international public relations problems for the Federal government. In such cases, serious damage can result for agricultural innovation and service operations. Here, the confidentiality impact level may be moderate. In other cases, unauthorized disclosure of information regarding creation, storage, and transportation of dangerous plant disease vectors, animal disease vectors, pesticides, and herbicides might facilitate malicious activities by terrorists or other criminals. Here, there is a potential for loss of human life, so the confidentiality impact level may be high.</confidentiality_explanation>

        <title>Energy Supply</title>
        <description>Energy Supply involves all activities devoted to ensuring the availability of an adequate supply of energy for the United States and its citizens. Energy Supply includes the sale and transportation of commodity fuels such as coal, oil, natural gas, and radioactive materials. This function also includes distributing and transferring power, electric generation, and/or storage located near the point of use. Impacts to some information and information systems associated with energy supply may affect the security of critical infrastructures, particularly in the areas of energy transmission and transport. The following recommended provisional categorization of the energy supply information type is particularly subject to change where critical infrastructure elements or nuclear materials are involved:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-low</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-moderate</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-moderate</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of energy supply information on the ability of responsible agencies to conduct activities related to the sale and transportation of commodity fuels such as coal, oil, natural gas, and radioactive materials. This function also includes distributing and transferring power, electric generation, and/or storage located near the point of use. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of energy supply information can have a serious economic impact with respect to competitive advantages and financial and commodity market dynamics. Also, the unauthorized disclosure of supply information may assist terrorists in the theft of energy products or disruption of energy distribution channels. Facilitation of theft of nuclear materials is a particularly catastrophic potential result of unauthorized disclosure of specific types of energy supply information. In these cases, the confidentiality impact must be considered to be high. [Some information regarding transportation and storage of nuclear materials is classified. The classified information is national security related and is outside the scope of this guideline. Other information, such as Nuclear Regulatory Commission “SAFEGUARDS” information is not national security information, but must be treated as having high confidentiality impact.] With respect to possible use by terrorists of energy distribution information regarding petroleum, natural gas, and other flammable or explosive products, a realistic impact assessment must include energy distribution information from private companies. This information is also susceptible to access by terrorists. Where distribution of hazardous energy products is involved, there is a potential unauthorized disclosure consequence of loss of human life and major property. In such cases the confidentiality impact level can be moderate or high. [Disclosure of transportation routes and storage facilities is often (i) both authorized and necessary to mission accomplishment and (ii) authorized, or even mandated, for public safety reasons.] Also, the unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s energy supply information by another agency could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the energy distribution infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked with energy supply.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for most energy supply information is low.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to energy supply information. Typically, disruption of access will have a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission, functions, or public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals. Also, most energy supply information is not time-critical. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Mission-critical systems: Functions supported by mission-critical information or information systems (e.g., electrical power generation, transmission, and/or distribution; petroleum or gas pipelines) are often adversely impacted by lack of availability. Loss of availability of the information or information system can result in severe impacts to the environment, service, major assets and/or human safety. Consequently, the availability impact level associated with these types of mission-critical processes/systems may be high.

        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of energy conservation and preparedness information on the ability of responsible agencies to protect energy resources from over-consumption to ensure the continued availability of fuel resources and to promote environmental protection. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of energy conservation and preparedness information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, unauthorized disclosure of preliminary findings or policies under consideration regarding proposed conservation measures or the distribution of energy in the event of an emergency may result in mobilization of special interests. These groups may successfully oppose necessary conservation measures and be given an unfair advantage for specific commercial interests. Also, the unauthorized disclosure may cause domestic or international loss of confidence in the Federal government. In such cases, serious damage may result for energy conservation and preparedness operations. Therefore, the confidentiality impact level may be moderate. In other cases, unauthorized disclosure of information regarding measures taken to ensure the provision of energy in the event of an emergency may facilitate malicious activities of terrorists. Here, there is a potential for loss of human life resulting from extended outages, so the confidentiality impact level may be high.</confidentiality_explanation>

        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of air transportation information on the ability of responsible agencies to ensure the safe passage of passengers and goods through the air. The protection of air transportation from deliberate attack is included in the Transportation Security information type under the Homeland Security mission area. Some regulatory and tariff enforcement functions associated with the safe passage of passengers and goods over land involve sensitive information. These are treated under Law Enforcement. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of air transportation information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of information (e.g., investigations, maintenance) that has not been adequately researched, coordinated, or edited can result in serious economic harm to individuals and to corporations. Loss in public confidence is a further potential consequence. Additionally, some information associated with air transportation functions is proprietary to corporations or subject to privacy laws. In such cases, the confidentiality impact resulting from unauthorized disclosure can be moderate. The sensitivity of air transportation information (e.g., aircraft positioning data)can be time or event-driven. For example, passenger lists are not releasable to the general public before a flight takes off, but are placed in the public domain in the event of a crash. In such cases, the confidentiality impact resulting from unauthorized disclosure can be moderate. Also, much military air transport information is national security information and is outside the scope of this guideline.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for air transportation information is low.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to air transportation information. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Some air transportation functions are time-critical (e.g., air traffic control instructions, position reports, situational awareness, separation, weather reports for the terminal area, microburst tracking, maintenance trouble reports). Loss of availability of time-critical information necessary to these functions can result in large-scale property loss and in loss of human lives. Timing plays a large part in the availability impact of air transportation information. For example, the time criticality of weather information may be measured in minutes or hours in the case of pre-flight and mid-flight operations. However, on final landing approach, up to the second availability may be required (e.g., detection of microbursts in the terminal area). Air operations are not tolerant of information loss. The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) supplements the availability of information available from the Department of Defense's Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Because of the potential system-wide impacts from a loss of availability of this system, it would be appropriately categorized as having a high availability impact. The following example illustrates the use of controls to address a high integrity impact level: The systems designed for command and control for air traffic control (e.g., the NAS systems) have been designed for robust operations. However, in general, loss of availability for the majority of systems does not cause derogation in safety. The impacts of a loss of availability (or the loss of availability due to the loss of integrity) include local or system-wide air traffic delays, diversion of traffic to alternate airports, etc., and the economic losses related to those delays, diversions, etc. Severe impacts are not the norm because the loss of availability is inevitable, and the systems have been designed to accommodate failures. In light of the above, the Recommended Availability Impact Level is moderate.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>The provisional availability impact level recommended for most air transportation information is low.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Many air transportation functions do not process time-critical information. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Some air transportation functions are time-critical (e.g., air traffic control instructions, position reports, situational awareness, separation, weather reports for the terminal area, microburst tracking, maintenance trouble reports). Communications management (e.g., frequency management) information also needs to be included in air transportation integrity impact considerations. There may be circumstances under which erroneous frequency assignment information can result in a loss of communications with aircraft that are affected by hazardous conditions (e.g., loss of communications with an aircraft in a crowded air space.) Unauthorized modification or destruction of time-critical information necessary to these functions can result in large-scale property loss and in loss of human lives. The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) supplements the availability and integrity of position information available from the DoD's Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Because of the potential system-wide impacts from a loss of integrity of this system, a high integrity impact level is recommended. The following example illustrates the use of controls to address a high integrity impact level: Systems designed for command and control for air traffic control (e.g., the NAS systems) have been designed for robust operations. In the NAS, integrity and availability issues are closely linked. The loss of integrity in a system is monitored continuously, and the loss of integrity is treated as a loss of availability, and in general, loss of availability for the majority of systems does not cause derogation in safety. That is, if the operational parameters for an Instrument Landing System are detected to be out of established tolerances, the system is immediately removed from service - it is powered down and users are notified that the particular service is not available. In most cases, a loss of availability is preferred to continued availability with degraded integrity. The impacts of the loss of availability due to the loss of integrity include system-wide air traffic delays, diversion of traffic to alternate airports - and the economic losses related to those delays, diversions, etc. Severe impacts are not the norm because the loss of availability is assumed to be inevitable, and the systems have been designed to accommodate failures. In light of the above, the Recommended Integrity Impact Level is moderate.</integrity_explanation>

        <title>General Retirement and Disability</title>
        <description>General Retirement and Disability involves the development and management of retirement benefits, pensions, and income security for those who are retired or disabled. Related information types affecting qualification and disbursement of benefits are discussed in Appendix C’s Sections C.2.8.8, C.2.8.9, C.2.8.10, C.2.8.11, and C.3.2.5. The recommended provisional categorization of the general retirement and disability information type follows:</description>

        <availability>fips-199-moderate</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-moderate</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of general retirement and disability information on the ability of responsible agencies to develop and manage retirement benefits, pensions, and income security for those who are retired or disabled. The consequences of limited unauthorized disclosure of retirement and disability information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. The disclosure of privacy information (e.g., information required by the Privacy Act of 1974 or other statutes and executive orders to receive special handling to protect the privacy of individuals) may have serious consequences. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Unauthorized disclosure of large amounts of general retirement and disability information may result in significant damage to an agency’s image or operation.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The confidentiality impact recommended for general retirement and disability information is moderate.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to general retirement and disability information. The effects of disruption of access to general retirement and disability information or information systems would have, in many cases, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Where provision of retirement and/or disability benefits is a primary agency service delivery mission, the consequences can be more severe. Availability compromises may result in reduction of benefits – and in extreme cases can be life threatening. This can result in assignment of a high impact level to such information.</availability_explanation>

        <availability>fips-199-moderate</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of criminal apprehension information on the ability of responsible agencies to track and capture groups or individuals believed to be responsible for committing Federal crimes, on public safety, and on the safety of law enforcement officers. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of criminal apprehension information depend 1) on the seriousness of the crime involved, 2) on the capability and predisposition of the criminal to injure or kill civilians or law enforcement officials, 3) timing (e.g., the ability of the criminal to access the information and use it to facilitate a crime or evade capture), and 4) statutory and regulatory requirements which vary by violation. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In cases where 1) the crimes are not violent and do not involve large property losses, and 2) there is no history of violence on the part of the criminal, the confidentiality impact may be low or moderate. For many crimes that are the responsibility of Federal law enforcement agencies, the consequences associated with unauthorized disclosure of criminal apprehension information must often be assumed to pose a threat to human life or result in a loss of major assets. In such cases, confidentiality impact level is high.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>For most Federal law enforcement systems that support criminal apprehension activities the harm that results from unauthorized disclosure will be limited. Therefore, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for criminal apprehension information is low.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to criminal apprehension information. Missions supported by criminal apprehension information are not typically tolerant of delay. While there are many cases in which elements of criminal apprehension information are not urgent, there are many in which relatively short periods of unavailability can pose a threat to human life and/or result in a loss of major assets.</availability_explanation>

        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal apprehension information may depend on the urgency with which the information is needed and on the success of subsequent prosecution of the apprehended criminal(s). Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal apprehension information may have an adverse effect on the subsequent prosecution of the apprehended criminal. Consequently, a serious adverse effect on agency operations can result. This can place the agency at a significant disadvantage. In such cases, the integrity impact level recommended for criminal apprehension information is at least moderate. When the criminal apprehension information is time-critical, the unauthorized modification or destruction of this information may have a severe or catastrophic effect on public confidence in the agency, pose a significant threat to major assets, and/or pose a threat to human life. This is applicable for many crimes that are the responsibility of Federal law enforcement agencies. For this criminal apprehension information, the Recommended Integrity Impact Level is high.</integrity_explanation>

        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of criminal investigation and surveillance information on the ability of responsible agencies to collect evidence required to determine responsibility for a crime, to monitor and question affected parties, and to protect the safety of witnesses and law enforcement officers. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of criminal investigation and surveillance information depend 1] on the seriousness of the crime involved, 2] timing (e.g., the ability of the criminal39 to access the information and use it to facilitate a crime, to evade detection or surveillance, or eliminate probable cause for searches and warrants), and 3] on the capability and predisposition of the criminal to injure witnesses or law enforcement officials. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In cases where 1) the crimes are not violent and do not involve large property losses, and 2) there is no history of violence on the part of the criminal, the confidentiality impact may be low or moderate. Given the nature of many of the crimes that are the responsibility of Federal law enforcement agencies, the consequences associated with unauthorized disclosure of criminal investigation and surveillance information must often be assumed to pose a threat to human life or result in a loss of major assets. Information that reveals the identity and/or location of informants may be of particular concern. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level is high.</confidentiality_explanation>

        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to criminal investigation and surveillance information. Missions supported by criminal investigation and surveillance information are not always tolerant of delay. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: There are some cases in which relatively short periods of unavailability of criminal investigation and surveillance information may result in lost surveillance opportunities or opportunities to make an arrest. Where the crimes involved pose a threat to human life and/or result in a loss of major assets, the availability impact level recommended for criminal investigation and surveillance information is high.</availability_explanation>

The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal investigation and surveillance information depends on the urgency with which the information is needed and on the success of subsequent prosecution of the apprehended criminal(s). Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually be limited. Where unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal investigation and surveillance information can have an adverse effect on the granting or execution of a search or wiretap warrant or on the success of subsequent prosecution of the apprehended criminal a serious adverse effect on agency operations can result. This can place the agency at a significant disadvantage. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In some cases, major investigations can be jeopardized when the time-critical criminal investigation and surveillance information is modified or destroyed. Where the criminal case under investigation involves major property losses, large-scale financial frauds that have serious implications for financial markets, poses a threat to key national assets or human life, the Recommended Integrity Impact Level is high. In international matters, such as trade enforcement, tariff agreements, etc., or where foreign nationals might be involved, the integrity impact level for criminal investigation and surveillance information will be high. Any compromise of such information could result in catastrophic adverse effects on future operations, individual and agency reputations, and on human life.</integrity_explanation>

        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of citizen protection information on the ability of responsible agencies to protect the general population of the United States from criminal activity. In some cases, the criminal activity is terrorist activity intended to cause mass casualties. While the results of unauthorized disclosure of most citizen protection information are unlikely to have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, the exceptions can have catastrophic consequences. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of citizen protection information could be severe. If detailed intelligence information regarding a planned terrorist act was disclosed, the terrorists might succeed in countering the protection measures and carry out a devastating attack. The confidentiality impacts associated with information concerning defensive dispositions would be high. While the adverse effects of unauthorized disclosure of some citizen protection information on law enforcement operations, assets, and individuals are limited; the stakes are usually higher. Federal citizen protection activities often seek to protect the public against life-threatening situations or against loss of major assets.</confidentiality_explanation>

        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to citizen protection information. Many citizen protection missions are usually tolerant of reasonable delays. Most criminal activity against citizen protection information is not life threatening but can result in serious property loss. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Emergency situations or elevated terrorist threat conditions are not tolerant of delays. Where systems support time-sensitive operations for life-threatening situations, the availability impact level for citizen protection information is high.</availability_explanation>

        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of property protection information on the ability of responsible agencies to ensure the security of civilian and government property. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of property protection information are generally dependent on the nature of the property being protected. Where the property being protected is neither critical to agency operations nor of such value that its loss would degrade mission capability or place the agency at a significant disadvantage, unauthorized disclosure would have a limited adverse effect. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where critical infrastructure facilities or key national assets are being protected, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of property protection information might reveal vulnerabilities in protection measures to terrorists or other adversaries. Where unauthorized disclosure of property protection information associated with critical infrastructures, large groups of people, or key national assets is expected to be of direct use to terrorists, the confidentiality impact level is high. Most protected facilities are not part of national security, the critical infrastructure, or key national asset categories. If unauthorized disclosure of property protection information resulted in damage to these facilities, serious adverse effects on agency operations and assets could reasonably be expected to result. This can result in assignment of a moderate or high impact level to such information. Where the property being protected involves classified information, the property protection information itself might be classified. Some examples include command and control and other military facilities, foreign intelligence collection or processing facilities, weapons or weapons facilities, and cryptographic activities. National security information is outside the scope of this guideline.</confidentiality_explanation>

Where the property being protected is neither critical to agency operations nor of such value that its loss would degrade mission capability or place the agency at a significant disadvantage, unauthorized disclosure would have a limited adverse effect. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where critical infrastructure facilities or key national assets are being protected, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of property protection information might reveal vulnerabilities in protection measures to terrorists or other adversaries. Where unauthorized disclosure of property protection information associated with critical infrastructures, large groups of people, or key national assets is expected to be of direct use to terrorists, the confidentiality impact level is high. Most protected facilities are not part of national security, the critical infrastructure, or key national asset categories. If unauthorized disclosure of property protection information resulted in damage to these facilities, serious adverse effects on agency operations and assets could reasonably be expected to result. This can result in assignment of a moderate or high impact level to such information. Where the property being protected involves classified information, the property protection information itself might be classified. Some examples include command and control and other military facilities, foreign intelligence collection or processing facilities, weapons or weapons facilities, and cryptographic activities. National security information is outside the scope of this guideline.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to property protection information. Missions supported by property protection information are not typically tolerant of delays, but the consequences of loss of availability of most property protection information are limited. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: The consequences of inability of guard forces and other emergency responders to receive property protection information in a timely manner may result in catastrophic consequences for properties that could include critical infrastructures and key national assets. In general, the availability impact level assigned to property protection information is dependent on what is being protected. This can result in assignment of a moderate or high impact level to such information.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>The provisional availability impact recommended for most property protection information is low.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of property protection information depends on the type of property being protected and on the immediacy with which the information is expected to be used. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure can be expected to have limited adverse consequences. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency. However, the potential damage to the protection mission will usually be of greater concern. If the modified or destroyed information is tactical i.e., time-critical, there is a greater potential for actions being taken based on incomplete or false information. This can have serious adverse effects on protection operation. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.</integrity_explanation>

        <title>Substance Control</title>
        <description>Substance control supports activities associated with the enforcement of legal substances (i.e., alcohol and tobacco) and illegal narcotics laws including trafficking, possession, sale, distribution, and other related activities. The provisional security categorization recommended for the substance control information type is as follows:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-moderate</confidentiality>

        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of substance control information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce legal substances (i.e., alcohol and tobacco) and illegal narcotics laws including trafficking, possession, sale, distribution, and other related activities. Unauthorized disclosure of a significant proportion of substance control information can compromise investigations, cause apprehension operations to fail, and compromise prosecutions. This can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations and place the agency at a significant disadvantage. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some routine substance control information is unlikely to have more than a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. The confidentiality impact associated with such information is low. Where the unauthorized disclosure of information exposes sensitive information sources or compromises investigative or interdiction operations, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of substance control information may have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, significantly degrade mission capability, and/or pose a threat to human life. Where unauthorized disclosure endangers investigations in process, investigative or intelligence information sources, or information regarding witnesses or other critical case file elements, the danger to human life and key agency missions can be significant. Where unauthorized disclosure endangers witnesses or law enforcement officers, the impact level must be rated as high. Other factors affecting confidentiality impacts associated with substance control information are discussed under Section D.16.1 (Criminal Apprehension) and Section D.16.2 (Criminal Investigation and Surveillance). Some substance control information is classified (e.g., some intelligence-derived information). Classified information and other national security information are outside the scope of this guideline</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for most substance control information is moderate.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to substance control information. Most substance control processes are usually tolerant of reasonable delays. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: The consequences of unavailability of information can be serious if the information is critical to tactical operations i.e., is time-critical. Failure of some processes during tactical operations can result in both threats to human life and severe harm to public confidence in the agency. The impact level assigned to information and information systems associated with these tactical processes is high.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>The provisional availability impact level recommended for most substance control information is moderate.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The amount of money available to perpetrators significantly increases the insider threat. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of information can be serious if the information is critical to tactical operations i.e., is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to most missions would usually be limited Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction of information (particularly time-critical information) affecting internal communications can jeopardize investigations, prosecutions, the lives of witnesses, and the safety of enforcement officers. In some cases, unauthorized modification or destruction of information can result in loss of human life. In such cased, the integrity impact level is high. Other factors affecting integrity impacts associated with substance control information are discussed under Section D.16.1 (Criminal Apprehension) and Section D.16.2 (Criminal Investigation and Surveillance).</integrity_explanation>

Generally, the unauthorized disclosure of crime prevention information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In a few cases, details of crime prevention programs are sensitive (e.g., location of actively monitored surveillance cameras where only a fraction of camera feeds are monitored). In such cases, unauthorized disclosure of crime prevention information might have a serious adverse effect on crime prevention operations by eliminating uncertainty regarding surveillance patterns. Therefore, the confidentiality impact might be moderate.</confidentiality_explanation>

        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of trade law enforcement information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce various Customs laws. Unauthorized disclosure of trade law enforcement information could potentially jeopardize fulfillment of other trade law enforcement missions. Some information that has supported a trade law enforcement process might be of higher sensitivity, and unauthorized disclosure of this information might jeopardize the success of future trade law enforcement processes. The subsequent threat to agency image or reputation can cause a serious adverse effect on an agency’s mission capability. Where information includes names of informants, informant contacts, or agency personnel, the effectiveness of those personnel in future enforcement activities can be permanently impaired, or their lives threatened.

        <title>Legal Defense</title>
        <description>Legal defense refers to the representation of a defendant in a criminal/civil court of law in an attempt to provide constitutional guarantees to legal representation. The sensitivity of much legal information is highly lifecycle-dependent. From a confidentiality perspective, most information associated with litigation and judicial activities is in the public record after the information has been presented in court. The recommended provisional security categorization for the legal defense information type is as follows:</description>

        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-high</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of legal defense information on the representation of a defendant in a criminal/civil court of law and on the ability of the government to provide constitutional guarantees to legal representation. Dissemination of legal defense information is governed by privacy laws and by Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rules of Civil Procedure, and other laws governing adversarial legal proceedings. While much information associated with legal defense is public, some information is sealed by the court or is otherwise protected from disclosure. Violation of rules regarding unauthorized disclosure is punishable by law, disbarment, fine, and/or imprisonment. Generally, the unauthorized disclosure of legal defense information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Where unauthorized disclosure of information might have a serious adverse effect on legal defense, there is a presumption of a miscarriage of justice. If an unauthorized disclosure is discovered, the legal proceeding may be jeopardized (e.g., a mistrial may be declared). The cost to the government and others in terms of finance, time, and disruption to normal operations can be severe. If suspicion is raised concerning government complicity or negligence, serious loss of public confidence in government agencies or the legal process may result. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where the life of a victim, witness, or informant may be endangered by disclosure, the confidentiality impact will be high. Also, where the consequences of a miscarriage of justice are likely to endanger public safety (e.g., release of a terrorist or other murderer), the confidentiality impact will be high.</confidentiality_explanation>

        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of resolution facilitation information on the ability of responsible entities to settle a dispute between two or more parties (government, citizen, corporation) outside of a court of law. While some information associated with resolution facilitation is public, much of the information is private and/or proprietary. Unauthorized disclosure of such information can disrupt or defeat the dispute resolution process. The consequences typically depend on the nature of the dispute. Jeopardy to the resolution process will not usually involve threats to critical infrastructures, key national assets, or human life. Typically, the unauthorized disclosure of resolution facilitation information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where large monetary amounts and/or violent crimes are involved, the confidentiality impact of unauthorized disclosure of resolution facilitation information is at least moderate. In exceptional cases human lives may be jeopardized by failure of the resolution facilitation process. Additionally, when resolution facilitation concerns matters of trans-national interest, such as trade enforcement, tariff agreements, etc., or where foreign nationals might be involved, the confidentiality impact will be high.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>Given the legal consequences of unauthorized disclosure, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for resolution facilitation information is moderate.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to resolution facilitation information. Most resolution facilitation processes are tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to resolution facilitation information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on government operations, agency assets, or individuals.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>The provisional availability impact level recommended for resolution facilitation information is low.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Resolution facilitation activities are not typically time-critical. The modification or destruction of court records may result in disruption or jeopardy of legal proceedings. In most cases, the adverse effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of resolution facilitation information on agency mission functions and/or public confidence in the agency can be expected to be limited.</integrity_explanation>
        <integrity_recommendation>The provisional integrity impact level recommended for resolution facilitation information is low.</integrity_recommendation>

        <title>Criminal Incarceration</title>
        <description>Criminal incarceration includes activities associated with the housing, custody and general care of criminals sentenced to serve time in penitentiaries. The following security categorization is recommended for the criminal incarceration information type:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-low</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-moderate</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of criminal incarceration information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide housing, custody, and general care for criminals sentenced to serve time in a Federal penitentiary. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most criminal incarceration information are unlikely to have a serious adverse effect on agency operations. The most serious adverse effects are likely to involve exposure of information that is proprietary to prisoners that can result in damaging publicity for an organization. (Unauthorized disclosure of some information can conceivably have serious impact on the status or resolution of appeal actions). The consequences of unauthorized disclosures may have an adverse effect on public confidence in the agency.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for most criminal incarceration information is normally low.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to criminal incarceration information. Criminal incarceration processes are usually tolerant of reasonable delays. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: There may be cases (e.g. emergency bulletins affecting prisoner health and/or safety) in which emergency dissemination of information regarding life-threatening situations is delayed for excessive periods. Such cases can result in a high availability impact level.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>The provisional availability impact level recommended for criminal incarceration information is low.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal incarceration information can be serious if the information is time-critical and results in the premature release of a criminal, unjust retention of an individual in the prison system, or harm to a citizen’s reputation or public confidence in the government. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In some cases (e.g., instructions regarding a need to isolate a prisoner from the general prison population for personal safety reasons), the unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal incarceration information can result in loss of human life a high impact potential.</integrity_explanation>
        <integrity_recommendation>The provisional integrity impact level recommended for criminal incarceration information is moderate.</integrity_recommendation>

        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of criminal rehabilitation information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide convicted criminals with the educational resources and life skills necessary to rejoin society as responsible and contributing members. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most criminal rehabilitation information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Exceptions that might have a potential for more serious consequences are based on privacy information processed in criminal rehabilitation systems (e.g., information required by the Privacy Act of 1974 (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type) or other statutes and executive orders to receive special handling to protect the privacy of individuals). This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.</confidentiality_explanation>

        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level depends on the effect of unauthorized disclosure of research and development information on the ability of responsible agencies to gather and analyze data, disseminate results, and develop new products, methodologies, and ideas, and on the degree to which unauthorized disclosure of the information can assist hostile institutions to do harm to the interests of the government of the United States. Many research and development activities are conducted in association with public institutions of higher learning, and the findings resulting from those activities are intended for publication. Unauthorized disclosure of most research and development information can be expected to have only limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Most research and development information is proprietary. Unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information violates several statures and Federal regulations (see Appendix E). Pre-publication disclosure or other unauthorized disclosure of research findings can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level associated with research and development is moderate. Premature and/or partial release of preliminary research and development information can lead to misleading conclusions by policy makers, funding entities, news organizations, and/or the general public. Where the research and development activities are associated with security measures or law enforcement tools, potential adversaries may derive insights on countermeasures development.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized premature disclosure of much economic (e.g., agricultural commodity, economic indicators) data and statistics information can result in major financial consequences. In some cases, premature disclosure of this information can impact major financial markets and damage national banking and finance infrastructures. Unauthorized and premature disclosure to a single institution (e.g., a major commodity brokerage house), could damage faith in general-purpose data and statistics gathering and development institutions, result in even more market disruption, and have a severe or catastrophic adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. Even when the consequences are limited to giving an unfair market advantage to a single financial or commercial institution, unauthorized disclosure can have a serious adverse effect on public confidence in the agency and its staff.

Premature and unauthorized disclosure of information being considered for broadcast can be harmful if the information is subsequently determined to be false or counterproductive to the knowledge dissemination mission. However, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most knowledge dissemination information would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some policies governing knowledge dissemination missions can be harmful to the agency mission (e.g., some internal Voice of America editorial policies).

        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-moderate</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of inspections and auditing information on the ability of responsible agencies to methodically examine and review regulated activities to ensure compliance with standards for regulated activity. If the inspections and auditing data belongs to one of the information types described in this guideline, the confidentiality impact assigned the data and system is dependent on the nature of the regulated activity. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of inspections and auditing information can alert personnel associated with programs being monitored to the focus of inspection or auditing activities. With this information, program personnel may divert attention from questionable program attributes or hide unfavorable information. Where a major program or human safety is at stake, actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure of inspections and auditing information can pose a threat to human life or a loss of major assets. In such cases, the confidentiality impact is high. National security information and national security systems are outside the scope of this guideline.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>Although there are many Federal environments in which unauthorized disclosure will have only a limited adverse effect, there are enough circumstances in which serious adverse effects on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals can result to justify recommendation of a moderate provisional confidentiality impact level for inspections and auditing information.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to inspections and auditing information. In most cases, disruption of access to inspections and auditing information is expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Not many inspection or auditing operations involve activities for which temporary loss of availability is likely to cause significant degradation in mission capability, place the agency at a significant disadvantage, result in major damage to major assets, or pose a threat to human life.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>For most inspection and audit functions, the recommended provisional availability impact level is low.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of inspections and auditing information can compromise the effectiveness of the program. The damage likely to be caused by unauthorized modification or destruction may affect inspection or audit results with subsequent serious adverse effects on agency operations or public confidence in the agency. The consequences can be particularly serious if the destruction or modification of information invalidates oversight of major programs or the information threatens human safety. The integrity impact level depends on the laws or policies with which compliance is being determined and on the criticality of the processes being monitored (e.g., correctness of contract expenditure reporting versus safety regulations affecting manned space flight).</integrity_explanation>
        <integrity_recommendation>Although there are regulatory environments in which a low impact level is appropriate, the circumstances associated with most inspections and auditing support information require at least a moderate provisional integrity impact level.</integrity_recommendation>

        <description>Standard Setting/Reporting Guideline Development involves the establishment of allowable limits associated with a regulated activity and the development of reporting requirements necessary to monitor and control compliance with allowable limits. This includes the development of requirements for product sampling and testing, emissions monitoring and control, incident reporting, financial filings, etc. The following provisional security categorization is recommended for the standards setting/reporting guideline development information type:</description>

        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of standards setting/reporting guideline development information on the abilities of responsible agencies to establish allowable limits associated with a regulated activity and to develop reporting requirements necessary to monitor and control compliance with allowable limits. In a few cases, the unauthorized public dissemination of standards or guidelines information can harm the effectiveness of the function being supported (e.g., public dissemination of Internal Revenue Service audit thresholds for certain deductions). However, most Federal standards and guidelines are intended for public dissemination. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of the majority of standards setting/reporting guideline development information will result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. There are some cases for which standards or guidelines include classified or other national security information. Such cases are outside the scope of this guideline.</confidentiality_explanation>

        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of standards setting/reporting guideline development information depends primarily on the criticality of the information with respect to agency mission capability, protection of agency assets, and safety of individuals. In general, the effects of modifications or deletions of standards setting/reporting guideline development information are limited with respect to agency missions or assets.</integrity_explanation>

In most cases, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of public resources, facilities, and infrastructure management information will result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, premature unauthorized disclosure of management information can give an unfair competitive advantage to a commercial interest (e.g., proposed changes for management of petroleum reserves). The confidentiality impact of consequent loss of public confidence and/or serious economic disruption might be moderate. In other cases, public resources, facilities, and infrastructure management details can be of use to terrorists or other criminals who seek to penetrate the security of government property or to harm populations.

        <title>Information Infrastructure Management</title>
        <description>Information Infrastructure Management involves the management and stewardship of a type of information by the Federal Government and/or the creation of physical communication infrastructures on behalf of the public in order to facilitate communication. This includes the management of large amounts of information (e.g., environmental and weather data, criminal records, etc.), the creation of information and data standards relating to a specific type of information (patient records), and the creation and management of physical communication infrastructures (networks) on behalf of the public. Note: Information infrastructures for government use are not included in this information type because the impact levels associated with information infrastructure maintenance information are primarily a function of the information processed in that infrastructure. The recommended provisional security categorization for the information infrastructure maintenance information type is as follows:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-low</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>

        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of information infrastructure maintenance information on the ability of responsible agencies to manage a type of information and/or to create physical communication infrastructures on behalf of the public in order to facilitate communication. The disclosure of most information infrastructure maintenance information can be expected to result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, information infrastructure maintenance details can be of use to terrorists or other criminals who seek to destroy government data bases or communications infrastructures, or deny access to information needed by the public. Unauthorized disclosure of some information infrastructure maintenance details to criminals can result in danger to critical infrastructures, key national assets, or human life. In such cases, the confidentiality impact can be high. In other cases, premature unauthorized disclosure of management information can give an unfair competitive advantage to a commercial interest (e.g., proposed outsourcing of system administration or details of a proposed communications system acquisition). This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for information infrastructure maintenance information is low.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to information infrastructure maintenance information. Disruption of access to information infrastructure maintenance information or information systems will typically result in denial of access to resources for all affected agencies. Typically, disruption of access will have a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency response aspects of disaster management or other time critical functions (e.g., some systems that support air traffic control functions). The availability impact level associated with unauthorized modification or destruction of information infrastructure maintenance information needed to respond to emergencies or critical to public safety may be high.</availability_explanation>

That is, the consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of information infrastructure maintenance information typically depend on the criticality of the data processed by the infrastructure and whether this data is time-critical. In most cases, the data will not be urgently needed or acted upon immediately. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In a relatively few cases, the consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of information infrastructure maintenance information might result in serious damage to agency operations, assets, or human safety.

The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. In many cases, premature and unauthorized disclosure can affect the integrity of the grants process, giving an unfair competitive advantage to one or more applicants. In such cases, punitive consequences and/or loss of public confidence can have a seriously disruptive effect on an agency’s operations and mission. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level would be moderate. In some cases, federal grants information might be moderate to high impact.

Therefore, the information maintained by all the individuals/agencies may be necessary to alter a grants decision. In most cases, the adverse effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of federal grants information on agency mission functions or public confidence in the agency is limited. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: There are significant differences between the ability to modify a document authorizing a payment and the modification of the payment itself. The unauthorized modification of a document authorizing a payment is less time critical than the modification of the payment itself while the payment is in transit.

        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of direct loan information on the ability of responsible agencies to disburse Federal funds to non-Federal borrowers under contract terms that require the repayment of such funds with or without interest. Much direct loan information includes information covered by the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type.) In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of direct loan information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of large volumes of information protected under the Privacy Act can be expected to have a serious to severe effect on public confidence in the agency. In such cases, the confidentiality impact can be moderate.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for direct loan information is low.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to direct loan information. Loan assistance processes are generally tolerant of delay. In most cases, disruption of access to direct loan information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>The provisional availability impact level recommended for direct loan information is low.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. Loan assistance activities are not generally time-critical. In most cases, the adverse effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of direct loan information on agency mission functions and public confidence in the agency will be limited. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: There are significant differences between the ability to modify a document authorizing a payment and the modification of the payment itself. The unauthorized modification of a document authorizing a payment is less time critical than the modification of the payment itself while the payment is in transit. Modifications to payments in transit will result in immediate inaccurate payments. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.</integrity_explanation>

        <title>General Insurance</title>
        <description>General Insurance involves providing protection to individuals or entities against specified risks. The specified protection generally involves risks that private sector entities are unable or unwilling to assume or subsidize and where the provision of insurance is necessary to achieve social objectives. The following provisional security categorization is recommended for the general insurance information type:</description>
        <confidentiality>fips-199-low</confidentiality>
        <availability>fips-199-low</availability>
        <integrity>fips-199-low</integrity>
        <confidentiality_explanation>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of general insurance information on the abilities of responsible agencies to provide protection to individuals or entities against specified risks. General insurance activities include both insurance issuing and insurance servicing. Insurance issuing is any activity such as provider approval, underwriting, and endorsements. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of insurance issuing information will generally result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Insurance servicing supports activities associated with administering and processing insurance include payment processing, initial and final closings, loss mitigation, claims management, and retiring insurance. The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing information on the abilities of responsible agencies to administer and process insurance. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing information will generally result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The more serious consequences may result from 1) unauthorized disclosure of provider’s proprietary information, or 2) premature disclosure of agency plans or changes under consideration for contracts, plans, or policies. Unauthorized disclosure of information that can affect contract arrangements to the detriment of the interests of the government, and of the public at large (e.g., planned or anticipated termination of a major contract insurer), can result in damaging increases in public expense and exposure to impact. In the case of unauthorized disclosure to an individual private sector organization, unfair competitive advantage may result – with major financial consequences. In the case of unauthorized disclosure of preliminary and unsubstantiated data that is both incorrect and pessimistic (e.g., Medicare budget projections,), the consequent unwarranted alarm of the public may have serious political and operational consequences for affected agencies. In the more serious cases, the confidentiality impact will be at least moderate. The more serious consequences of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing information may result from unauthorized disclosure of private information concerning the insured (e.g., Privacy Act information). (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type.) In the more serious cases, the confidentiality impact will be at least moderate.</confidentiality_explanation>
        <confidentiality_recommendation>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for general insurance information is low.</confidentiality_recommendation>
        <availability_explanation>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to general insurance information. The nature of general insurance processes is usually tolerant of reasonable delays. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Extensive delays in insurance servicing activities can result in financial harm for individuals and businesses and in public alarm and repercussions in the financial markets. In more serious cases, delays may have serious political and operational consequences for affected agencies. In such cases, the confidentiality impact may be at least moderate.</availability_explanation>
        <availability_recommendation>The provisional availability impact level recommended for general insurance information is low.</availability_recommendation>
        <integrity_explanation>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of general insurance information may depend on the urgency with which the information is typically needed. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) typically has a limited adverse effect on agency operations and/or public confidence in the agency.</integrity_explanation>
