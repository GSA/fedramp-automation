## 2. FedRAMP Extensions and Allowed Values

NIST designed the core OSCAL syntax to model cybersecurity information that is common to most organization and compliance frameworks; however, NIST also recognized the need to provide flexibility or organizations with unique information needs.

Instead of trying to provide a language that meets each organization\'s unique needs, NIST designed OSCAL with 
the ability to be extended.

As a result, FedRAMP-compliant OSCAL files are a combination of the core OSCAL syntax and extensions defined by FedRAMP. The [*Guide to OSCAL-Based FedRAMP Content*](/guides/general/) describes the concepts behind FedRAMP extensions and allowed values. The extensions related to the System Security Plan (SSP) are cited in this document in context of their use.

**FedRAMP extensions and allowed** **values are cited in relevant portions of this document and summarized in the** **FedRAMP OSCAL Registry.**
