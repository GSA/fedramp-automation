## 2. FedRAMP Extensions and Allowed Values

NIST designed the core OSCAL syntax to model cybersecurity information
that is common to most organization and compliance frameworks; however,
NIST also recognized the need to provide flexibility or organizations
with unique information needs.

Instead of trying to provide a language that meets each organization\'s
unique needs, NIST provided designed OSCAL with the ability to be
extended.

As a result, FedRAMP-compliant OSCAL files are a combination of the core
OSCAL syntax and extensions defined by FedRAMP. The [*Guide to OSCAL-Based FedRAMP Content*](/guides/general/)
describes the concepts behind FedRAMP extensions and allowed values. The
extensions related to the Security Assessment Plan (SAP) are cited in
this document in context of their use.

**FedRAMP extensions and allowed values are cited in relevant portions
of this document and summarized in the FedRAMP OSCAL Registry.**
