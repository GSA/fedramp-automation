                This is an example of a revised assessment platform.


                Ideally, all assessment platforms and components are defined in the
                SAP. If there is a departure from what is defined in the SAP, it must
                be defined in the SAR.


                This is a mixed example showing a revised component (a different assessment
                laptop defined as a component in the SAR) being paired with tools
                previously defined in the SAP.

            Even though the policy may be defined in the SSP and OSCAL would allow
            the SAR to reference it, FedRAMP requires the assessor attach all evidence
            to the SAR..

          FedRAMP is formulating guidelines for handling digital/electronic
          signatures in OSCAL, and welcome feedback on solutions.


          For now, FedRAMP recommends one of the following:


          * Render the OSCAL SAR content as a PDF that is digitally signed and attached.

          * Render the OSCAL SAR content as printed pages that are physically signed,
          scanned, and attached.



          If your organization prefers another approach, please seek prior approval
          from the FedRAMP PMO.
