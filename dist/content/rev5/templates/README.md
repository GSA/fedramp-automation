# REV5 TEMPLATES DEPRECATED

The FedRAMP OSCAL templates will be renamed and repurposed as example files.  These files will not be intended for use as templates or starter documents for creating OSCAL content.  Instead, they will simply be available for OSCAL content authors as a reference for illustrative examples of how to represent certain information in FedRAMP OSCAL documents.  The files will be relocated to the `/src/content/rev5/examples` folder.

**NOTE - DEPRECATED CONTENTS WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE CODEBASE WHEN THE NEXT MAJOR RELEASE IS MADE AVAILABLE**
