# REV5 RESOURCES DEPRECATED

The experimental **fedramp_extensions.xml** and **fedramp_values.json** files will be deprecated, as described in [ADR #007](/documents/adr/007-signal-unsupportent-content-in-github.md).  FedRAMP will explore other options for providing information about FedRAMP OSCAL extension (all `prop` assemblies with `@ns="https://fedramp.gov/ns/oscal"' namespace) and allowed values with the community. Stand by for updates.

**NOTE - DEPRECATED CONTENTS WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE CODEBASE WHEN THE NEXT MAJOR RELEASE IS MADE AVAILABLE**
