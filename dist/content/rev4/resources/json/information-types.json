Premature public release of proposed legislation before\n                internal coordination and review has been conducted can result in unnecessary\n                criticism of the proposed legislation and even damage public confidence in the\n                agency. These consequences are particularly likely where the release includes\n                unedited internal commentary and discussion. In general, unauthorized disclosure of\n                much legislative proposal information, particularly in early phases of the process,\n                is likely to result in serious harm to agency assets or operations. 40 Special\n                Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some proposal development\n                information used by specific Federal agencies (e.g., homeland security, law\n                enforcement, defense, intelligence community) is very sensitive or classified\n                national security information. National security information is outside the scope of\n                this guideline. The sensitivity level recommended for the very sensitive information\n                is high. If the proposal development information is moved to the public domain, the\n                confidentiality impact level becomes Not Applicable (NA)."},

The IRS Guidebook for Information Sensitivity Analysis provides guidelines\n                for identifying IRS Official Use Only (OUO) Information. Sensitive information is\n                identified in the IRM as any information which if lost, stolen, (accessed), or\n                altered without proper authorization may adversely affect Service operations. The\n                IRM states that unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information may cause lawsuits\n                against Service officials as well as the Service, unwanted notoriety for the\n                Service, and public distrust of the Service\u2019s ability to protect such information \u2013\n                all of which may result in an increase in noncompliance with tax laws. It notes that\n                unauthorized release of information such as the name and address of an informant (in\n                cases of tax evasion or fraud) may threaten a person\u2019s life.17 Additionally,\n                sensitive information is defined in Section 25.10 of the IRM as information that\n                requires protection due to the risk or magnitude of loss that could result from\n                inadvertent or deliberate disclosure of the information. Sensitive information\n                includes information whose improper use could adversely affect the ability of the\n                agency to accomplish its mission, proprietary information, records about individuals\n                that require protection under the Privacy Act, and information not releasable under\n                the Freedom of Information Act.

Unauthorized disclosure of\n                raw data and other source information for identity authentication operations is\n                likely to violate the Privacy Act of 1974 and other regulations applicable to the\n                dissemination of personal and government information. There are many cases in which\n                unauthorized disclosure of personal identity and authentication information will\n                have only a limited adverse effect on government operations, assets, or individuals.\n                However, the potential for use of such information by criminals to perpetrate\n                identity theft and related fraud can do serious harm to individuals. Unauthorized\n                disclosure of centrally managed personal identity and authentication information,\n                such as passport and visa control databases can have a serious adverse effect on\n                agency missions. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: For\n                agencies that manage large income information involving records of the general\n                public, the provisional confidentiality impact level can be expected to be at least\n                moderate.

The consequences of\n                unauthorized disclosure of most facilities, fleet, and equipment management\n                information are likely to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,\n                agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact\n                Determination: Information associated with maintenance, administration, and\n                operation of many Federal government office buildings, transportation fleets, and\n                operational facilities can be of material use to criminals seeking to gain access to\n                Federal facilities in order to facilitate or perpetrate fraud, theft, or some other\n                criminal enterprise (e.g., extract inmates from Federal detention facilities). In\n                this case, unauthorized disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect\n                on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.

Border control involves enforcing\n                the laws regulating the admission of foreign-born persons (i.e., aliens) to the\n                United States. This includes patrolling and monitoring borders and deportation of\n                illegal aliens. Some border control information is also associated with other\n                mission information types (e.g., criminal apprehension, and criminal investigation\n                and surveillance information). In such cases, the impact levels of the associated\n                mission information may determine impact levels associated with border control\n                information. Some aspects of ensuring security of transportation and infrastructure\n                networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States are also\n                covered under the information types associated with the transportation mission.

                "confidentiality-explanation": {"p": "The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of border\n                control information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce laws\n                regulating the admission of foreign-born persons (i.e., aliens) to the United\n                States. Generally, the effects of unauthorized disclosure of border control\n                information are usually confined to a single geographic region, immigration case, or\n                deportation case. Even so, unauthorized disclosure may have a serious adverse effect\n                on mission functions, cause significant degradation in mission capability, or place\n                the agency at a significant disadvantage with respect to its border control\n                responsibilities. Particularly in the case of immigration, naturalization, and\n                deportation activities, unauthorized disclosure of information can violate privacy\n                policies. Such unauthorized disclosures can have a serious effect on public\n                confidence in the agency. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact\n                Determination: Where border control information is also associated with other\n                mission information types (e.g., criminal apprehension, and criminal investigation\n                and surveillance information), the confidentiality impact level associated with the\n                information may be high. Where unauthorized disclosure of border control information\n                may put the physical safety of personnel into serious jeopardy, the confidentiality\n                impact level associated with the information may be high. Unauthorized disclosure of\n                confidentiality of information associated with ensuring security of transportation\n                and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United\n                States can result in facilitation of terrorist activities that endanger human life.\n                In some cases, the consequent threat to critical infrastructures, key national\n                assets, and human life can be catastrophic. Consequently, the confidentiality impact\n                level associated with information associated with ensuring security of\n                transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel\n                within the United States is normally high"},

Functions and processes supported by most border control\n                information are not time-critical. Also, disruption of access will have only a\n                limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions and public\n                confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting\n                Availability Impact Determination: There may be time critical cases, for example,\n                information regarding transport of illegal aliens or information about a physical\n                threat posed by aliens that border control personnel have been assigned to\n                interdict. In such cased, the availability impact will be high. The consequences of\n                disruption of access to information or information systems associated with ensuring\n                security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and\n                personnel within the United States may be severe. Also, anti-terrorism missions are\n                not reliably tolerant of delays.

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting\n                external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect\n                operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would\n                usually be limited. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of\n                information can be very serious if the information is critical to tactical\n                operations. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized\n                modification or destruction of information associated with ensuring security of\n                transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel\n                within the United States may seriously affect mission operations or result in the\n                loss of human life.

The purpose of disaster monitoring and prediction activities is\n                generally to disseminate information. Sharing of raw information by a diverse group\n                of analysts often improves the quality of predictive analysis. Special Factors\n                Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized\n                disclosure of some disaster monitoring and prediction information may include public\n                panic or other responses that jeopardize public safety, disaster prevention,\n                emergency response, disaster repair, or restoration missions. For example, attempts\n                of large populations to evacuate in an endangered area before necessary preparations\n                are made for evacuation routes can result in a clogging of the routes and failure to\n                evacuate large parts of the population in time to save them from a life-threatening\n                event.

The\n                consequences of failed conflict resolution activities may pose threats to human life\n                and major property assets The level of confidentiality impact assigned to treaties\n                and agreements information is determined by the ability of responsible agencies to\n                negotiate and implement accords with foreign governments and organizations in\n                efforts related to arms reduction and regulation, trade matters, criminal\n                investigations and extraditions, and other types of foreign policy. Unauthorized\n                disclosure of information associated with treaties and agreements can reasonably be\n                expected to prevent successful negotiation and/or ratification of treaties and\n                agreements. This is particularly true of prematurely released resolution factors,\n                personality assessments, and proposed solutions to adversaries. Some information\n                that has supported a treaty or other international agreement process may undo the\n                results of a successfully completed treaty or agreement. The subsequent threat to\n                public confidence in the agency can cause a catastrophic adverse effect on an\n                agency\u2019s mission capability. When the disclosed information includes candid opinions\n                of agency personnel, or background information on agency personnel, the\n                effectiveness of those personnel for future agency missions may be permanently\n                impaired.

Also, the unauthorized disclosure of supply information\n                may assist terrorists in the theft of energy products or disruption of energy\n                distribution channels. Facilitation of theft of nuclear materials is a particularly\n                catastrophic potential result of unauthorized disclosure of specific types of energy\n                supply information. In these cases, the confidentiality impact must be considered to\n                be high. [Some information regarding transportation and storage of nuclear materials\n                is classified. The classified information is national security related and is\n                outside the scope of this guideline. Other information, such as Nuclear Regulatory\n                Commission \u201cSAFEGUARDS\u201d information is not national security information, but must\n                be treated as having high confidentiality impact.] With respect to possible use by\n                terrorists of energy distribution information regarding petroleum, natural gas, and\n                other flammable or explosive products, a realistic impact assessment must include\n                energy distribution information from private companies. This information is also\n                susceptible to access by terrorists. Where distribution of hazardous energy products\n                is involved, there is a potential unauthorized disclosure consequence of loss of\n                human life and major property. In such cases the confidentiality impact level can be\n                moderate or high.

Unauthorized disclosure to a single institution (e.g., a major\n                banking institution or brokerage house), could damage faith in regulatory\n                institutions and result in even more market disruption and have a severe or\n                catastrophic adverse effect on public confidence in the agency.

In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of air transportation\n                information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or\n                individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination:\n                Unauthorized disclosure of information (e.g., investigations, maintenance) that has\n                not been adequately researched, coordinated, or edited can result in serious\n                economic harm to individuals and to corporations. Loss in public confidence is a\n                further potential consequence. Additionally, some information associated with air\n                transportation functions is proprietary to corporations or subject to privacy laws.\n                In such cases, the confidentiality impact resulting from unauthorized disclosure can\n                be moderate. The sensitivity of air transportation information (e.g., aircraft\n                positioning data)can be time or event-driven. For example, passenger lists are not\n                releasable to the general public before a flight takes off, but are placed in the\n                public domain in the event of a crash. In such cases, the confidentiality impact\n                resulting from unauthorized disclosure can be moderate. Also, much military air\n                transport information is national security information and is outside the scope of\n                this guideline."},

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact\n                Determination: Some air transportation functions are time-critical (e.g., air\n                traffic control instructions, position reports, situational awareness, separation,\n                weather reports for the terminal area, microburst tracking, maintenance trouble\n                reports). Loss of availability of time-critical information necessary to these\n                functions can result in large-scale property loss and in loss of human lives. Timing\n                plays a large part in the availability impact of air transportation information. For\n                example, the time criticality of weather information may be measured in minutes or\n                hours in the case of pre-flight and mid-flight operations. However, on final landing\n                approach, up to the second availability may be required (e.g., detection of\n                microbursts in the terminal area). Air operations are not tolerant of information\n                loss. The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) supplements the availability of\n                information available from the Department of Defense's Global Positioning Systems\n                (GPS). Because of the potential system-wide impacts from a loss of availability of\n                this system, it would be appropriately categorized as having a high availability\n                impact. The following example illustrates the use of controls to address a high\n                integrity impact level: The systems designed for command and control for air traffic\n                control (e.g., the NAS systems) have been designed for robust operations. However,\n                in general, loss of availability for the majority of systems does not cause\n                derogation in safety. The impacts of a loss of availability (or the loss of\n                availability due to the loss of integrity) include local or system-wide air traffic\n                delays, diversion of traffic to alternate airports, etc., and the economic losses\n                related to those delays, diversions, etc. Severe impacts are not the norm because\n                the loss of availability is inevitable, and the systems have been designed to\n                accommodate failures. In light of the above, the Recommended Availability Impact\n                Level is moderate."},

Many air transportation functions do not process time-critical\n                information. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Some air\n                transportation functions are time-critical (e.g., air traffic control instructions,\n                position reports, situational awareness, separation, weather reports for the\n                terminal area, microburst tracking, maintenance trouble reports). Communications\n                management (e.g., frequency management) information also needs to be included in air\n                transportation integrity impact considerations. There may be circumstances under\n                which erroneous frequency assignment information can result in a loss of\n                communications with aircraft that are affected by hazardous conditions (e.g., loss\n                of communications with an aircraft in a crowded air space.) Unauthorized\n                modification or destruction of time-critical information necessary to these\n                functions can result in large-scale property loss and in loss of human lives. The\n                Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) supplements the availability and integrity of\n                position information available from the DoD's Global Positioning Systems (GPS).\n                Because of the potential system-wide impacts from a loss of integrity of this\n                system, a high integrity impact level is recommended. The following example\n                illustrates the use of controls to address a high integrity impact level: Systems\n                designed for command and control for air traffic control (e.g., the NAS systems)\n                have been designed for robust operations. In the NAS, integrity and availability\n                issues are closely linked. The loss of integrity in a system is monitored\n                continuously, and the loss of integrity is treated as a loss of availability, and in\n                general, loss of availability for the majority of systems does not cause derogation\n                in safety. That is, if the operational parameters for an Instrument Landing System\n                are detected to be out of established tolerances, the system is immediately removed\n                from service - it is powered down and users are notified that the particular service\n                is not available. In most cases, a loss of availability is preferred to continued\n                availability with degraded integrity. The impacts of the loss of availability due to\n                the loss of integrity include system-wide air traffic delays, diversion of traffic\n                to alternate airports - and the economic losses related to those delays, diversions,\n                etc. Severe impacts are not the norm because the loss of availability is assumed to\n                be inevitable, and the systems have been designed to accommodate failures.

Given the nature of many of the crimes that are the responsibility of\n                Federal law enforcement agencies, the consequences associated with unauthorized\n                disclosure of legal investigation information will pose a threat to human life or\n                result in a loss of major assets. Additionally, when the disclosure concerns matters\n                of multi-national interest, such as trade enforcement, tariff agreements, etc., or\n                where foreign nationals might be involved, the confidentiality impact will be high.\n                Information that reveals the identity and/or location of informants may be of\n                particular concern."},

The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of legal\n                investigation information may depend on whether the information is time-critical.\n                Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external\n                communications associated with legal investigative organizations (e.g., web pages,\n                electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency,\n                but the damage to the mission would usually be limited.

Dissemination of legal prosecution/litigation\n                information is governed by privacy laws and by Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rules of\n                Civil Procedure, and other laws governing adversarial legal proceedings. While most\n                information associated with legal prosecution/litigation is public, some information\n                is sealed by the court or is otherwise protected from disclosure. Violation of rules\n                regarding unauthorized disclosure is punishable by law, disbarment, fine, and/or\n                imprisonment. Generally, the unauthorized disclosure of legal prosecution/litigation\n                information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or\n                individuals. In criminal cases, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of legal\n                prosecution information are affected by 1] the seriousness of the crime involved, 2]\n                timing (e.g., the ability of the criminal to access the information and use it to\n                commit a crime or evade detection or surveillance), and 3] the capability of the\n                criminal to injure witnesses or law enforcement officials. Special Factors Affecting\n                Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where unauthorized disclosure of information\n                might have a serious adverse effect on legal prosecution/ litigation, there is a\n                presumption of a miscarriage of justice. If an unauthorized disclosure is\n                discovered, the legal proceeding is jeopardized (e.g., a mistrial may be declared).\n                The cost to the government and others in terms of finance, time, and disruption to\n                normal operations can be severe. If suspicion is raised concerning government\n                complicity or negligence, serious loss of public confidence in government agencies\n                or the legal process may result. In this case, the confidentiality impact of\n                unauthorized disclosure will be moderate. Where the life of a complainant, victim,\n                witness, or informant may be endangered by disclosure, the confidentiality impact\n                will be high. Also, where the consequences of a miscarriage of justice are likely to\n                endanger public safety (e.g., release of a terrorist or other murderer), the\n                confidentiality impact will be high. Given the nature of many of the crimes that are\n                the responsibility of Federal law enforcement agencies, the consequences associated\n                with unauthorized disclosure of legal prosecution information must be assumed to\n                pose a threat to human life or result in a loss of major assets. Additionally, when\n                a legal proceeding concerns matters of trans-national interest, such as trade\n                enforcement, tariff agreements, etc., or where foreign nationals might be involved,\n                the confidentiality impact will be high. Information that reveals the identity\n                and/or location of informants may be of particular concern.

General insurance activities\n                include both insurance issuing and insurance servicing. Insurance issuing is any\n                activity such as provider approval, underwriting, and endorsements. The consequences\n                of unauthorized disclosure of insurance issuing information will generally result in\n                a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.\n                Insurance servicing supports activities associated with administering and processing\n                insurance include payment processing, initial and final closings, loss mitigation,\n                claims management, and retiring insurance. The confidentiality impact level is the\n                effect of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing information on the\n                abilities of responsible agencies to administer and process insurance.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The\n                more serious consequences may result from 1) unauthorized disclosure of provider\u2019s\n                proprietary information, or 2) premature disclosure of agency plans or changes under\n                consideration for contracts, plans, or policies. Unauthorized disclosure of\n                information that can affect contract arrangements to the detriment of the interests\n                of the government, and of the public at large (e.g., planned or anticipated\n                termination of a major contract insurer), can result in damaging increases in public\n                expense and exposure to impact. In the case of unauthorized disclosure to an\n                individual private sector organization, unfair competitive advantage may result \u2013\n                with major financial consequences. In the case of unauthorized disclosure of\n                preliminary and unsubstantiated data that is both incorrect and pessimistic (e.g.,\n                Medicare budget projections,), the consequent unwarranted alarm of the public may\n                have serious political and operational consequences for affected agencies. In the\n                more serious cases, the confidentiality impact will be at least moderate. The more\n                serious consequences of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing information\n                may result from unauthorized disclosure of private information concerning the\n                insured (e.g., Privacy Act information).
