# REV4 CONTENTS DEPRECATED

FedRAMP has updated its documentation and templates to align with NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5 (see https://www.fedramp.gov/rev5-transition/). All authorization and continuous monitoring activities going forward will be based on requirements in Revision 5, so FedRAMP Revision 4 baselines, resources, and templates are deprecated, as described in [ADR #007](/documents/adr/007-signal-unsupportent-content-in-github.md).

**NOTE - CONTENT IN THIS FOLDER OR SUBFOLDER IS DEPRECATED. SUBSEQUENT RELEASES WILL NOT INCLUDE THIS CONTENT.**
