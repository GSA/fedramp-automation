# REV4 CONTENTS DEPRECATED

The FedRAMP has updated the FedRAMP documentation and templates to reflect the changes in NIST SP 800-53 rev 5 (see https://www.fedramp.gov/rev5-transition/). All authorization and continuous monitoring activities going forward will be based on the rev 5 requirements, so FedRAMP rev 4 baselines, resources, and templates will no longer be maintained and will be deprecated, as described in [ADR #007](/documents/adr/007-signal-unsupportent-content-in-github.md).

**NOTE - DEPRECATED CONTENTS WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE CODEBASE WHEN THE NEXT MAJOR RELEASE IS MADE AVAILABLE**
