            For each control:
            1. Add prop to indicate if it is a core control
            2. For each test objectives (by-id)
                a. add response point
                b. add corresponding method (EXAMINE, INTERVIEW, TEST)
            3. For each control part, add response-point
            4. Add FedRAMP requirement and/or guidance
