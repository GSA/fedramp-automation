			Todo:
            For each control:
            1. Add prop to indicate if it is a core control
			2. For each control part (or control statement), indicate if it should be a response point (e.g., when developing SSP)
            3. For each test objectives (by-id), specify the testing method (EXAMINE, INTERVIEW, TEST)
