        <title>Corrective Action Information Type</title>
        <description>
            <p>Corrective Action involves the enforcement functions necessary to remedy programs
                that have been found non-compliant with a given law, regulation, or policy.</p>

        <confidentiality-explanation>
            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                corrective action information on the ability of responsible agencies to remedy
                internal or external programs that have been found non-compliant with a given law,
                regulation, or policy. Unauthorized disclosure of most corrective action information
                should have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or
                individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where
                more sensitive information is involved, it will probably be personal information
                subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 or information that is proprietary to a
                corporation or other organization. Such information will often be assigned a
                moderate confidentiality impact level. The Privacy Act Information provisional
                impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information
                type. Additionally, there are legislative mandates prohibiting unauthorized
                disclosure of trade secrets. Trade secrets will generally be assigned a moderate
                confidentiality impact level.</p>

        <confidentiality-recommendation>
            <p>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for corrective action
                information is low.</p>
        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the
                corrective action information. The availability impact is also dependent on whether
                the data is time-critical. In most cases, disruption of access to corrective action
                information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency
                operations, agency assets, or individuals.</p>

        <integrity-explanation>
            <p>The consequences of undetected unauthorized modification or destruction of corrective
                action information can conceivably compromise the effectiveness of compliance
                enforcement actions (e.g., by providing violators with a basis for claiming
                investigative or enforcement irregularities, thus supporting legal challenges to
                proposed corrective actions). The integrity impact level is based on the specific
                mission and the data supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the
                modification or destruction of information. Unauthorized modification or destruction
                of most corrective action information should have only a limited adverse effect on
                agency operations, assets, or individuals.</p>

        <title>Program Evaluation</title>
        <description>
            <p>Program Evaluation involves the analysis of internal and external program
                effectiveness and the determination of corrective actions as appropriate. The impact
                levels should be commensurate with the impact levels of the program that is being
                evaluated. For example, if the program contains very sensitive financial data with
                moderate impact levels for confidentiality and integrity, the program evaluation
                impact levels for confidentiality and integrity should also be moderate.</p>

        </integrity-impact>
        <confidentiality-explanation>
            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of program
                evaluation information on the abilities of responsible agencies to analyze internal
                and external program effectiveness and to determine appropriate corrective actions.
                The confidentiality impact of program evaluation information is largely
                event-driven. Once the evaluation has been reported, most program evaluation
                information is in the public domain. However, premature unauthorized disclosure of
                program evaluation information can alert personnel associated with programs under
                evaluation to the focus and preliminary findings of investigative and evaluation
                activities.</p>
            <p>Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where a major
                programs or human safety is at stake, actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure
                of program evaluation information can pose a threat to human life or a loss of major
                assets. In such cases, the confidentiality impact is high. Unauthorized disclosure
                of most program evaluation information often has the potential to seriously affect
                agency operations. Also, some program evaluation information, particularly in the
                case of current investigations, includes personal information subject to the Privacy
                Act of 1974 and/or information that is proprietary to a corporation or other
                organization. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented
                in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Additionally, there
                are legislative mandates prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets. Trade
                secrets will generally be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact level. If the
                program evaluation information is moved to the public domain, the confidentiality
                impact level becomes Not Applicable (NA).</p>
        </confidentiality-explanation>
        <confidentiality-recommendation>
            <p>Because there are many cases in which unauthorized disclosure of program evaluation
                information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or
                individuals, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for program
                evaluation information is low.</p>

                program evaluation information. Although there are time-sensitive exceptions, most
                program evaluation processes are tolerant of reasonable delays. In most cases,
                disruption of access to program evaluation information can be expected to have only
                a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.</p>

            <p>The consequences of undetected unauthorized modification or destruction of program
                evaluation information can compromise the effectiveness of an evaluation program
                (e.g., by providing false information intended to mislead investigators or
                evaluators or to give program personnel a basis for claiming investigative or
                evaluative irregularities). The integrity impact level is based on the specific

        <title>Program Monitoring</title>
        <description>
            <p>Program Monitoring involves the data-gathering activities required to determine the
                effectiveness of internal and external programs and the extent to which they comply
                with related laws, regulations, and policies. The impact levels should be
                commensurate with the impact levels of the programs that are being monitored. For
                example, if a program contains very sensitive financial data with moderate impact
                levels for confidentiality and integrity, the program monitoring impact levels for
                confidentiality and integrity should also be moderate.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of program
                monitoring information on the ability of responsible agencies to perform
                data-gathering activities required to determine the effectiveness of internal and
                external programs and the extent to which they comply with related laws,
                regulations, and policies. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact
                Determination: There are legislative mandates prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of
                trade secrets. Trade secrets will generally be assigned a moderate confidentiality
                impact level. Note that national security information and national security systems
                are outside the scope of this guideline. Otherwise, where the data being collected
                belongs to one of the information types described in this guideline, the
                confidentiality impact assigned the data and system is that of the highest impact
                information type collected. Unauthorized disclosure of program monitoring
                information can alert personnel associated with programs being monitored to the
                focus and implications of monitoring activities. Where a major programs or human
                safety is at stake, actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure of program
                monitoring information can pose a threat to human life or a loss of major assets. In
                such cases, the confidentiality impact is high. If the program monitoring
                information is moved to the public domain, the confidentiality impact level becomes
                Not Applicable (NA).</p>
        </confidentiality-explanation>
        <confidentiality-recommendation>
            <p>Although there are many circumstances in which serious adverse effects on agency
                operations, agency assets, or individuals can result to justify a moderate base
                confidentiality impact level for program monitoring information, in most Federal
                environments, unauthorized disclosure will have only a limited adverse effect on
                agency operations, assets, or individuals. Consequently, for most systems, a low
                provisional confidentiality impact level is recommended for program monitoring
                information.</p>
        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the
                program monitoring information. Although there may be time-sensitive program
                monitoring situations, more typically, disruption of access to program monitoring
                information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
                assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination:
                There are a limited number of compliance monitoring operations for which temporary
                loss of availability is likely to significantly degrade mission capability, place
                the agency at a significant disadvantage, result in loss of major assets, or pose a
                threat to human life. This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to
                such information.</p>
        </availability-explanation>
        <availability-recommendation>
            <p>The provisional availability impact level recommended for program monitoring
                information is low.</p>
        </availability-recommendation>
        <integrity-explanation>
            <p>The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of program monitoring
                information can compromise the effectiveness of the monitoring program. Although
                there may be time-sensitive program monitoring situations, the integrity impact
                level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting that mission, not on
                the time required to detect the modification or destruction of information. The
                damage likely to be caused by unauthorized modification or destruction of program
                monitoring information may have consequent serious adverse effects on agency
                operations or public confidence in the agency.</p>
        </integrity-explanation>
        <integrity-recommendation>
            <p>There are some regulatory environments in which a high or moderate impact level is
                appropriate. For most compliance monitoring information, the recommended provisional
                integrity impact level is low.</p>
            <p>Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: The consequences can be
                particularly serious if the destruction or modification of monitoring information
                invalidates evaluation results concerning major programs or concerning threats to
                human safety. The integrity impact resulting from unauthorized modification or
                deletion of program monitoring information depends in part on the nature of the laws
                or policies with which compliance is being determined and in part on the criticality
                of the processes being monitored. For example, in the case of safety regulations
                affecting manned space flight, the integrity impact level may be high.</p>

        <title>Policy and Guidance Development</title>
        <description>
            <p>Policy and Guidance Development involves the creation and dissemination of guidelines
                to assist in the interpretation and implementation of regulations. In most cases,
                the effect on public welfare of a loss of policy and guidance development mission
                capability can be expected to be delayed rather than immediate. As a result, the
                potential for consequent loss of human life or of major national assets is
                relatively low, since these most catastrophic consequences of impairment to mission
                capability can, in most cases, be corrected before they are fully realized.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of policy
                and guidance information on the ability of responsible agencies to create and
                disseminate guidelines to assist in the interpretation and implementation of
                regulations. The confidentiality impact of policy and guidance information is
                largely event-driven. Once a policy or guidance statement has been promulgated, most
                policy and guidance information is in the public domain. However, premature
                unauthorized disclosure of candidate policy and guidance material can result in
                disruption of (and inappropriate influence of special interests on) the policy
                development process. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination:
                The effects of loss of confidentiality of guidelines during the formative stage can
                result in attempts by affected entities and other interested parties to influence
                and/or impede the policy and guideline development process. Premature public release
                of formative policies and guidelines before internal coordination and review can
                result in unnecessary damage to public confidence in the agency. This is
                particularly likely where the release includes unedited internal commentary and
                discussion. Delays can impair an agency’s mission, but loss of public confidence can
                do serious and persistent harm to an agency’s ability to effectively perform its
                mission. In such cases, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for
                policy and guidance development information is moderate. When the policy and
                guidance information is in the public domain, the confidentiality impact level
                becomes Not Applicable (NA).</p>

            <p>Although there are cases in which unauthorized and premature disclosure of policy and
                guidance information can result in serious consequences for an agency, most of this
                information is intended to be available to the general public. Consequently, the

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of capital
                planning information on the ability of responsible agencies to ensure that
                appropriate investments are selected for capital expenditures. The effects of loss
                of confidentiality of capital investment plans during the formative stage can result
                in attempts by affected entities and other interested parties to influence and/or
                impede the policy and guideline development process. Premature public release of
                draft plans before internal coordination and review can result in unnecessary damage
                to public confidence in the agency. This is particularly likely where the release
                includes unedited internal commentary and discussion. The diversion of investment
                funds that can result from compromise of draft plans can pervert investment
                priorities in a manner that is prejudicial to public interest. However, the
                consequence of loss of confidentiality of most capital planning information is
                likely to do only limited harm to government assets, personnel, or missions. Special

                some of the background information that supports development of capital investment
                plans can reveal sensitive vulnerabilities, capabilities, or methods of
                anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national security activities. Depending on the
                information in question, the confidentiality impact can be moderate, high, or
                involve national security information (outside the scope of this guideline). Also,

                Determination: The effects of loss of confidentiality of budget execution
                information can violate privacy regulations, reveal information proprietary to
                private institutions, and reveal procurement-sensitive information. In aggregate,
                budget execution information can reveal capabilities and methods that some agencies
                (e.g., law enforcement, homeland security, national defense, intelligence) consider
                extremely sensitive. In these cases, the potential harm that can result from
                unauthorized disclosure ranges from moderate to high to national security-related.
                In the last case, the information is outside the scope of this document. Public
                release of sensitive budget execution information can result in unnecessary damage

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                management improvement information on the ability of responsible agencies to gauge
                the ongoing efficiency of business processes and identify opportunities for
                reengineering or restructuring. Premature public release of draft plans before
                internal coordination and review can result in unnecessary damage to public
                confidence in the agency. This is particularly likely where the release includes
                unedited internal commentary and discussion. However, the consequence of loss of
                confidentiality of most management improvement information is likely to involve only
                limited harm to government assets, personnel, or missions. Special Factors Affecting
                Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some background
                information that supports development of Federal management improvement plans can
                reveal personnel-sensitive information, including information subject to the Privacy
                Act of 1974. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in
                the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Other background
                information can reveal sensitive vulnerabilities, capabilities, or methods of
                anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national security activities. Depending on the
                information in question, the confidentiality impact can be moderate, high, or
                involve national security information (outside the scope of this guideline). Also,
                some strategic plans are themselves national security information.</p>

                Failure to detect malicious modification of personnel information (mostly background

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure budget and
                performance integration information on the abilities of responsible agencies to
                align Federal resources allocated through budget formulation, execution, and
                management actions. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of the majority of
                budget and performance integration information will result in a limited adverse
                effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors
                Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The effects of loss of
                confidentiality of budget and performance integration information can violate
                privacy regulations, reveal information proprietary to private institutions, and
                reveal procurement-sensitive information. In aggregate, budget and performance
                integration information can reveal capabilities and methods that some agencies
                (e.g., law enforcement, homeland security, national defense, intelligence) consider
                extremely sensitive. In these cases, the potential harm that can result from
                unauthorized disclosure ranges from moderate to high to national security-related.
                In the last case, the information is outside the scope of this document. Public
                release of sensitive budget and performance integration information can result in

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                contingency planning information on the ability of responsible agencies to plan for,
                respond to, and mitigate damaging events. Unauthorized disclosure of contingency
                planning information may equip an adversary with the information necessary to attack
                a system so that recovery is impaired. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality
                Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of background information that
                supports development of Federal contingency plans can reveal sensitive
                vulnerabilities, capabilities, intelligence assessments, intelligence sources, or
                methods employed in anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national security
                activities. Depending on the information in question, the confidentiality impact can
                be moderate, high, or involve national security information (outside the scope of
                this guideline). Also, some contingency plans are themselves national security
                information. However, the purpose of most contingency planning information is to
                protect against inadvertent or accidental damaging events rather than against
                malicious attacks. Even so, in the case of Federal government systems, the case of
                hostile attacks on systems must be considered. The consequences of unauthorized
                disclosure of extracts from contingency plans are likely to have negligible to
                limited adverse effects on agency operations. In such cases, the confidentiality
                impact would be, at most, low. Unauthorized disclosure of the entire plan to
                malicious entities may have serious effects. As a result, the consequence of loss of
                confidentiality of comprehensive contingency plans is likely to involve serious harm
                to government assets, personnel, or missions. In such cases, the confidentiality

            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the
                contingency planning information. The effects of disruption of access to contingency
                planning information or information systems depend on the timing of the disruption.
                If access to contingency planning information is denied because of a power outage,
                recovery may be delayed and the work of government agencies disrupted. Special
                Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: The contingency planning
                processes are usually tolerant of delays. In contrast, the contingency plan
                implementation process is not tolerant of delays. The consequences of disruption of
                access to contingency planning information depend on both the period of the outage
                and the criticality of the disrupted processes. The consequent impact level may

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                continuity of operations information on the ability of responsible agencies to
                identify critical systems and processes, and to conduct the planning and preparation
                required to ensure that these systems and processes will be available in the event
                of a catastrophic event. Unauthorized disclosure of the entire plan to malicious
                entities may have serious effects. As a result, the consequence of loss of
                confidentiality of most continuity of operations plans (and comprehensive continuity
                of operations plans) is likely to do serious harm to government assets, personnel,
                or missions. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination:
                Unauthorized disclosure of background information that supports development of
                Federal continuity of operations plans can reveal sensitive vulnerabilities,
                capabilities, intelligence assessments, intelligence sources, or methods employed in
                anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national security activities. Depending on the
                information in question, the confidentiality impact can be moderate, high, or
                involve national security information (outside the scope of this guideline).
                Unauthorized disclosure of continuity of operations information for critical
                infrastructures and key national assets may require a high impact level. However,
                the purpose of most continuity of operations information is to protect against
                inadvertent or accidental damaging events rather than against malicious attacks.
                Even so, in the case of Federal government systems, hostile attacks on systems must
                be considered. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of extracts from
                continuity of operations plans are likely to have negligible to limited adverse
                effects on agency operations. In such cases, the confidentiality impact would be, at
                most, low. Unauthorized disclosure of continuity of operations information may
                inform an adversary regarding what facilities and processes are considered to be
                critical. Such unauthorized disclosure may also equip an adversary with the
                information necessary to attack a system so that operations are disrupted, and that
                recovery is impaired. In such cases, the confidentiality impact would be, at least,
                moderate.</p>

                Determination: The effects of disruption of access to continuity of operations
                information or information systems depend on the timing of the disruption. If access
                to continuity of operations information is denied because of a power outage,
                recovery may be delayed and the work of government agencies disrupted. The
                continuity of operations planning process is usually tolerant of delays. In
                contrast, the continuity of operations implementation process is not tolerant of
                delays. The consequences of disruption of access to continuity of operations
                information depend on both the period of the outage and the criticality of the

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of the unauthorized disclosure of
                service recovery information on the ability of responsible agencies to develop plans
                for resuming operations after a catastrophe occurs, such as a fire or earthquake. In
                the case of service recovery plans for natural catastrophes, the information
                associated with service recovery planning is not intrinsically sensitive. In the
                case of catastrophes caused by malicious activity, unauthorized disclosure of
                service recovery information may inform an adversary regarding what facilities and
                processes are considered to be critical. Such unauthorized disclosure may also equip
                an adversary with the information necessary to attack a system in such a way that
                operations are disrupted, and that recovery is impaired or even blocked. The purpose
                of most service recovery information is to protect against natural catastrophes
                rather than against malicious attacks. In most cases, the consequence of loss of
                confidentiality of service recovery information is not likely to do serious harm to
                government assets, personnel, or missions. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality
                Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of background information that
                supports development of Federal service recovery plans can reveal sensitive
                vulnerabilities, capabilities, intelligence assessments, intelligence sources, or
                methods employed in anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national security
                activities. Depending on the information in question, the confidentiality impact can
                be moderate, high, or involve national security information (outside the scope of
                this guideline). Also, some service recovery plans are themselves national security
                information.</p>

                service recovery information. The effects of disruption of access to service
                recovery information or information systems depend on the timing of the disruption.
                If access to service recovery information is denied because of a power outage,
                recovery may be delayed and the work of government agencies disrupted. Special
                Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Service recovery planning
                processes are usually tolerant of delay. In contrast, the implementation of recovery
                plans is not tolerant of delays. For service recovery implementation, the
                consequences of access disruption depend on the time period of the disruption and
                the criticality of the disrupted processes. The consequent impact level may range

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of debt
                collection information on the ability of responsible agencies to properly and
                efficiently collect money owed to the United States government from both foreign and
                domestic sources. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of debt collection
                information are generally dependent on the identity of the debtor and of the nature
                and value of the debt being collected. Typically, unauthorized disclosure of debt
                collection information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
                assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact
                Determination: Where more sensitive information is involved, it will commonly be
                personal information subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, information that is
                proprietary to a corporation or other organization, or information that is
                politically sensitive by a foreign government. The Privacy Act Information
                provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication
                information type. Such information will often be associated with debt collection
                processes. Where the amount of the debt is significant, and unauthorized knowledge
                might imperil successful collection, then the associated confidentiality impact
                assigned to debt collection information might be moderate (or even high in the case
                of extremely high dollar value cases).</p>

                of debt collection information depend on the type of property being managed and on
                the immediacy with which the information is expected to be used. Special Factors
                Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: If the modified or destroyed information
                is substantive financial data, there is a greater potential for harm to result from
                actions being taken based on incomplete or false information. This can have serious
                adverse effects on individual financial actions with consequent loss of revenue
                from, or other unanticipated consequences regarding the personal property under
                disposition. The severity of the consequences depends on the type of the debt and of

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of the unauthorized disclosure of
                Federal asset sales information on the ability of responsible agencies to properly
                and efficiently acquire, oversee, track, and sell non-internal assets managed by the
                Federal Government with a commercial value and sold to the private sector. The
                consequences of unauthorized disclosure of Federal asset sales information are
                generally dependent on the nature and value of the property being disposed.
                Generally, Federal asset sales information is public. Most managed property would
                not be of sufficient individual value to occasion such an occurrence (bid rigging,
                etc.). Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where
                unauthorized knowledge regarding the property being disposed of might lead to unfair
                advantage (i.e., ability to accurately bid on an auction lot to the detriment of
                other bidders), then the associated confidentiality impact assigned to Federal asset
                sales information might be moderate. Such an instance might arise if a disruption of
                the proper procedures could reasonably cause an adverse effect on future operations
                of the responsible agency, or if the agency’s image, or individual reputations might

                delivery of information and support to the government’s customers. Most customer
                service information is likely to be in the public domain and poses no
                confidentiality impact. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of customer service
                information will have at most a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets,
                or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some
                customer service information may include customer-provided information covered by
                the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act Information provisional
                impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information
                type. Unauthorized disclosure of large volumes of information protected under the
                Privacy Act can be expected to have a serious to severe effect on public confidence
                in the agency. Actions taken that are intended to establish blame, compensate
                victims, or repair damage done with the exposed information can cause serious
                disruption of an agency’s mission capability. In such cases, the confidentiality
                impact can be moderate.</p>

                are not typically tolerant of delay. Even temporary loss of availability of customer
                service information is likely to disrupt customer operations. In most cases,
                disruption of access to customer service information can be expected to have only a
                limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special
                Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: While most outages will result
                in only limited adverse effects on government operations, repeated outages can have
                a serious adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. In such cases, the

                destruction of customer service information on overall agency mission functions or
                public confidence in the agency are limited. The more serious integrity impacts
                become increasingly likely as E-government initiatives progress. Typically, the
                unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external
                communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) will result in limited adverse
                affect on operations or public confidence in the agency and the damage to most
                missions would usually be limited. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact
                Determination: An increasing proportion of customer service activities are
                interactive. Consequently, there is a potential for customer actions being taken
                based on modified or incomplete information. Similarly, unauthorized modification or
                deletion of customer-supplied information can result in government mishandling of
                interactions with customers. If this occurs on a large-scale serious damage to
                public confidence in the agency may result. In such cases, a moderate integrity may

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                legislation testimony information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide
                testimony/evidence in support or, or opposition to, legislation from conception to
                adoption. Most testimony regarding legislation is in the public domain, and even
                premature release should result in no more than limited harm to agency assets,
                personnel, or operations. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact
                Determination: The effects of loss of confidentiality of some information applicable
                to pending testimony may result in attempts by competing interests to influence
                and/or impede a specific legislative process. The consequences to agency programs
                and of the ability of an agency to perform its mission can be very serious.
                Premature public release of draft testimony before internal coordination and review
                has been conducted can result in unnecessary criticism of the proposed testimony and
                damage public confidence in the agency. These consequences are particularly likely
                where the release includes unedited internal commentary and discussion. The results
                of unauthorized disclosure of information to the public can imperil specific agency
                programs, but a consequent loss of public confidence can do persistent harm to an
                agency’s ability to effectively perform its mission. This can result in assignment
                of a moderate impact level to such information. Some information associated with
                legislative testimony is classified national security information and is outside the

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of proposal
                development information on the ability of responsible agencies to draft proposed
                legislation that creates or amends laws subject to Congressional legislative action.
                Legislation is normally in the public domain. However, the effects of loss of
                confidentiality of background information used in the development of proposed
                legislation or of early drafts of proposed legislation could result in attempts by
                competing interests to influence and/or impede a specific legislative process. The
                consequences to agency programs and of the ability of an agency to perform its
                mission can be very serious. Premature public release of proposed legislation before
                internal coordination and review has been conducted can result in unnecessary
                criticism of the proposed legislation and even damage public confidence in the
                agency. These consequences are particularly likely where the release includes
                unedited internal commentary and discussion. In general, unauthorized disclosure of
                much legislative proposal information, particularly in early phases of the process,
                is likely to result in serious harm to agency assets or operations. 40 Special
                Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some proposal development
                information used by specific Federal agencies (e.g., homeland security, law
                enforcement, defense, intelligence community) is very sensitive or classified
                national security information. National security information is outside the scope of
                this guideline. The sensitivity level recommended for the very sensitive information
                is high. If the proposal development information is moved to the public domain, the
                confidentiality impact level becomes Not Applicable (NA).</p>

                Treasury performs on behalf of the Government.14 [Note: Tax-related functions are
                associated with the Taxation Management information type.] Impacts to some
                information and information systems associated with central fiscal operations may
                affect the security of the critical banking and finance infrastructure. In most
                cases, the effect on public welfare of a loss of central fiscal operations
                functionality can be expected to be delayed rather than immediate. The potential for

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of central
                fiscal operations information on the fiscal operations that the Department of
                Treasury performs on behalf of the Government. The effects of loss of
                confidentiality can reasonably be expected to jeopardize relationships and
                administrative actions necessary to mission fulfillment and/or to seriously damage
                public confidence in the agency. For example, the unauthorized disclosure of
                investigative and enforcement information can have serious economic impact on both
                individual companies and the broader market place (e.g., short-term stock market
                perturbations). The consequences of such unauthorized disclosures may have a serious
                adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. Special Factors Affecting
                Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where the operations in question involve
                liaison with law enforcement or homeland security organizations, the consequences of
                unauthorized disclosure can imperil operations critical to the security of human
                life, critical infrastructure protection, ore the protection of key national assets.
                For those operations, the consequences to key financial infrastructure elements can
                be serious to severe. In such cases, the associated confidentiality impact level
                will be high.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of central
                property management information on the ability of the General Services
                Administration to acquire, provide, and centrally administer offices buildings,
                fleets, machinery, and other capital assets and consumable supplies used by the
                Federal government. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most central
                property management information are likely to have only a limited adverse effect on
                agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting
                Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of information
                associated with very large procurements can result in fraud, waste, abuse, and/or
                legal proceedings that can have a serious to severe effect on Federal government
                assets and operations. Also, information associated with acquisition, maintenance,
                administration, and operation of many Federal government office buildings,
                transportation fleets, and operational facilities can be of material use to
                criminals seeking to gain access to Federal facilities to facilitate or perpetrate
                fraud, theft, or some other criminal enterprise. In this case, unauthorized
                disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations,
                agency assets, or individuals. The consequent confidentiality impact would be at
                least moderate. Information associated with maintenance, administration, and
                operation of other Federal government facilities can be of material use to
                terrorists seeking to penetrate and/or commandeer such facilities as part of
                operations intended to harm critical infrastructures, key national assets, or
                people. Examples of more potentially damaging information include architectural,
                maintenance and administrative information that might permit either covert
                pedestrian or unimpeded vehicular access to government buildings (e.g.,
                Congressional office buildings, FBI Headquarters, the National Archives, Smithsonian
                Institution buildings, dams, nuclear power plants, etc.). In such cases, the
                confidentiality impact level may be high. [Some information is classified as
                national security and is outside the scope of this guideline.] Anticipated or
                realized unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s central property management
                information by GSA could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional
                coordination within the central property management infrastructure and the general
                effectiveness of organizations tasked with acquiring and managing government
                facilities and supplies.</p>

                central property management information. The functions supported by most central
                property management information are tolerant of delays. Typically, the disruption of
                access to central property management information will have a limited adverse effect
                on agency operations (including mission functions and public confidence in the
                agency), agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Availability
                Impact Determination: Exceptions may include emergency response aspects of disaster
                management. In such cases, delays measured in hours can cost lives and major
                property damage. Consequently, the availability impact level associated with
                unauthorized modification or destruction of central property management information
                needed to respond to emergencies may be high.</p>

                Management (OPM) to build a high quality and diverse Federal workforce, based on
                merit system principles. Central personnel management information includes human
                resources management and consulting services, education and leadership development
                services, and investigation services. The unauthorized disclosure of most central
                personnel management information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
                operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact
                Determination: Very sensitive information is typically personal information subject
                to the Privacy Act of 1974. (The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels
                are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type.) Such
                information will often be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact level. Some
                information associated with investigative services may be particularly sensitive and

        <confidentiality-explanation>
            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of taxation
                management information on the ability of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to
                enforce the Internal Revenue Code and to collect taxes in the United States and
                abroad. The IRS Guidebook for Information Sensitivity Analysis provides guidelines
                for identifying IRS Official Use Only (OUO) Information. Sensitive information is
                identified in the IRM as any information which if lost, stolen, (accessed), or
                altered without proper authorization may adversely affect Service operations. The
                IRM states that unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information may cause lawsuits
                against Service officials as well as the Service, unwanted notoriety for the
                Service, and public distrust of the Service’s ability to protect such information –
                all of which may result in an increase in noncompliance with tax laws. It notes that
                unauthorized release of information such as the name and address of an informant (in
                cases of tax evasion or fraud) may threaten a person’s life.17 Additionally,
                sensitive information is defined in Section 25.10 of the IRM as information that
                requires protection due to the risk or magnitude of loss that could result from
                inadvertent or deliberate disclosure of the information. Sensitive information
                includes information whose improper use could adversely affect the ability of the
                agency to accomplish its mission, proprietary information, records about individuals
                that require protection under the Privacy Act, and information not releasable under
                the Freedom of Information Act. The IRS OUO guideline notes that prevention of
                unauthorized disclosure of information revealing internal matters, the disclosure of
                which would risk circumvention of a legal requirement or agency rules and
                regulations has assumed an increasingly important role in homeland security.
                Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or private IRS information can be expected to
                have a serious effect on both the welfare of individuals and public confidence in
                the government. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In
                cases where unauthorized disclosure of taxation information can impede
                anti-terrorism or other homeland security activities or endanger the lives of agents
                or informants, the confidentiality impact level is high.</p>
        </confidentiality-explanation>
        <confidentiality-recommendation>
            <p>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for taxation management
                information is moderate.</p>
        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the
                taxation management information. Taxation management processes are generally
                tolerant of limited delays. In most cases, disruption of access to taxation
                management information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on
                overall agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. However, even temporary
                loss of availability of taxation management information is likely to have an adverse
                effect on public confidence in the agency and on Federal government cash flow.
                Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: While most cases will
                result in only limited consequences, repeated disruptions can have a serious adverse
                effect on public confidence in the agency. This can significantly degrade the
                taxation management mission capability. In such cases, the availability impact might
                be moderate. Loss of availability of significant amounts of taxation management
                information over long periods of time can do serious harm to Federal government
                operations. The economic ramifications would potentially be severe.</p>

                destruction of taxation management information may depend on the urgency with which
                the information is needed or the immediacy with which the information is used. In
                most cases, it is unlikely that the information will be needed urgently or acted
                upon immediately. Also, the adverse effects of unauthorized modification or
                destruction of taxation management information on overall agency mission functions
                is expected to be limited. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination:
                There is a potential for tax code enforcement, other law enforcement, or
                anti-terrorism actions being taken based on modified or incomplete information.
                Also, unauthorized modification or destruction of taxation management information
                may result in distribution of false and misleading information. Such events can be
                expected to adversely affect individuals, operations, and/or public confidence in
                the agency. This can significantly degrade the taxation management mission
                capability. In extreme cases (e.g., misidentification of an informant), the
                consequences can be life threatening. In such cases, a high integrity impact may
                exist.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure
                of income information on the ability of the Federal government to identify citizen
                entitlements and obligations and to protect individuals against identity theft and
                the Federal government against fraud. Unauthorized disclosure of raw data and other
                source information for benefits determination and revenue collection operations is
                likely to violate the Privacy Act of 1974 and other regulations applicable to the
                dissemination of personal and government information. Unauthorized disclosure of
                centrally managed income information can have a serious adverse effect on agency
                missions. Therefore, for agencies that manage large income information involving
                records of the general public, the provisional confidentiality impact level can be
                expected to be at least moderate.</p>

        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific purpose to which income
                information is put; and not on the time required to re-establish access to the
                income information. Benefits determination and liability calculation (e.g.,
                taxation) processes are generally tolerant of reasonable delays. In many cases,
                disruption of access to income information can be expected to have only a limited
                adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors
                Affecting Availability Impact Determination: In the case of very large data bases
                containing income information relating to the general public, there is a significant
                probability that processing delays will affect the benefits entitlements or
                liabilities (e.g., tax liabilities) of large numbers of individuals. The larger the
                number of records affected, the longer the delays that can be expected to result.
                This can result in financial hardship for citizens and in serious disruption of the
                agency operations due to large time and resource requirements for backlog
                processing. In such cases, the availability impact level would be at least moderate.
                In the case of permanent loss of records, the impact might even be high.</p>

                information relating to the general public, there is a significant probability that
                erroneous actions will be taken affecting the benefits entitlements or liabilities
                (e.g., tax liabilities) of large numbers of individuals. This can result in at least
                short-term financial hardship for citizens. It can also be expected to result in
                very serious disruption of the agency operations due to large time and resource
                requirements for taking corrective actions. In such cases, the integrity impact
                level would be at least moderate. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact
                Determination: In the case of smaller organizations, and where the information

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is based on the effects of unauthorized disclosure
                of personal identity and authentication information on the ability of Federal
                agencies to determine that communications with and payments to individuals are being
                made with or to the correct individuals - and to protect individuals against
                identity theft and the Federal government against fraud. Unauthorized disclosure of
                raw data and other source information for identity authentication operations is
                likely to violate the Privacy Act of 1974 and other regulations applicable to the
                dissemination of personal and government information. There are many cases in which
                unauthorized disclosure of personal identity and authentication information will
                have only a limited adverse effect on government operations, assets, or individuals.
                However, the potential for use of such information by criminals to perpetrate
                identity theft and related fraud can do serious harm to individuals. Unauthorized
                disclosure of centrally managed personal identity and authentication information,
                such as passport and visa control databases can have a serious adverse effect on
                agency missions. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: For
                agencies that manage large income information involving records of the general
                public, the provisional confidentiality impact level can be expected to be at least
                moderate. Where personal identity and authentication information is used in
                controlling access to facilities (e.g., Federal facilities, critical infrastructure
                facilities, key national assets) or for border control purposes, the consequences of
                unauthorized disclosure that permits credentials forgery can justify a high impact
                assignment.</p>

            <p>An additional management and support sub-function information type has been defined
                to address General Information as a catch-all information type that may not be
                defined by the FEA BRM. As such, agencies may find it necessary to identify
                additional information types not defined in the BRM and assign impact levels to
                those types. Agency personnel may uniquely identify information types using a FIPS
                199 process to identify information not contained neatly in the FEA BRM. Not all of
                these information types are likely to have the same impact levels. The impacts to
                some information types will jeopardize system functionality and the agency mission
                more than other information types. General Information impact levels must be
                assessed in the context of the agencies mission.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Facilities, Fleet, and Equipment management involves the maintenance, administration,
                certification, and operation of office buildings, fleets, machinery, and other
                capital assets considered as possessions of the Federal government. Impacts to some
                information and information systems associated with facilities, fleet, and equipment
                management may affect the security of some key national assets (e.g., nuclear power
                plants, dams, and other government facilities).</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                facilities, fleet, and equipment management information on the ability of
                responsible agencies to maintain, administer, and operate offices buildings, fleets,
                machinery, and other capital assets of the Federal government. The consequences of
                unauthorized disclosure of most facilities, fleet, and equipment management
                information are likely to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
                agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact
                Determination: Information associated with maintenance, administration, and
                operation of many Federal government office buildings, transportation fleets, and
                operational facilities can be of material use to criminals seeking to gain access to
                Federal facilities in order to facilitate or perpetrate fraud, theft, or some other
                criminal enterprise (e.g., extract inmates from Federal detention facilities). In
                this case, unauthorized disclosure of information can have a serious adverse effect
                on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. The consequent confidentiality
                impact would be at least moderate. Information associated with maintenance,
                administration, and operation of other Federal government office buildings,
                transportation fleets, and operational facilities can be of material use to
                terrorists seeking to penetrate and/or commandeer such facilities as part of
                operations intended to harm critical infrastructures, key national assets, or
                people. Examples of this information include information that reveals specific
                measures respecting limiting access to and operation of government aircraft,
                maintenance and administrative information that might permit either covert
                pedestrian or unimpeded vehicular access to government buildings (e.g.,
                Congressional office buildings, FBI Headquarters, the National Archives, Smithsonian
                Institution buildings, dams, nuclear power plants, etc.), and schedules/itineraries
                of government surface transportation fleets (e.g., for transport of executive
                personnel or hazardous materials). In these cases, the confidentiality impact must
                be considered to be high. [Some information regarding transportation and storage of
                nuclear materials is classified as national security related and is outside the
                scope of this guideline. Other information, such as Nuclear Regulatory Commission
                “SAFEGUARDS” information is not national security information, but must have a high
                confidentiality impact level.] Anticipated or realized unauthorized disclosure of
                one agency’s facilities, fleet, and equipment management information by another
                agency could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within
                the facilities, fleet, and equipment management infrastructure and the general
                effectiveness of organizations tasked with facilities, fleet, and/or equipment
                management.</p>

        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the
                facilities, fleet, and equipment management information. Functions supported by most
                facilities, fleet, and equipment management information are tolerant of delays.
                Typically, disruption of access to facilities, fleet, and equipment management
                information has a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission
                functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals.
                Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include
                emergency response aspects of disaster management or leadership protection. In such
                cases, delays measured in seconds can cost lives and major property damage.
                Consequently, the availability impact level associated with unauthorized
                modification or destruction of facilities, fleet, and equipment management
                information needed to respond to emergencies will be high.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of security
                management information on the ability of responsible organizations to physically
                protect their personnel, assets, and facilities. The consequences of unauthorized
                disclosure of most security management information depend on the likelihood that the
                information might jeopardize the physical security of an organization’s assets and
                the value, and potential for damage of the assets being protected. Information
                associated with the physical security of many Federal government office buildings,
                transportation fleets, and operational facilities can be of material use to
                criminals seeking to gain access to Federal facilities in order to perpetrate a
                major crime (e.g., extraction of inmates from Federal detention facilities, theft of
                commodities market projections, access to information associated with a felony
                criminal investigation or prosecution, theft of blank license issuing facilities
                and/or materials, access to competition-sensitive information associated with major
                procurements, undetected access to national archives or museum properties, access to
                currency printing facilities or materials, theft of major currency or bullion
                storage facilities). In such cases, unauthorized disclosure of information can have
                a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
                Unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s security management information by another
                agency could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within
                the security management infrastructure and the general effectiveness of
                organizations tasked with physical protection of Federal facilities. The
                consequences of physical protection failures at most Federal facilities are more
                likely to result in serious21 adverse effects. Special Factors Affecting
                Confidentiality Impact Determination: Information associated with security
                management at other Federal government office buildings, transportation fleets, and
                operational facilities can be of material use to terrorists seeking to penetrate
                and/or commandeer such facilities as part of operations intended to harm critical
                infrastructures, key national assets, or people. Examples of more potentially
                damaging information includes information that reveals specific measures for
                protecting government aircraft, information that might permit access that creates an
                opportunity to bomb a government building (e.g., Congressional office buildings, FBI
                Headquarters, the National Archives, Smithsonian Institution buildings, dams,
                nuclear power plants, etc.), and leadership protection details that could result in
                assassination opportunities. In these cases, the confidentiality impact must be
                high. Unauthorized disclosure of security management information that can be
                reasonably expected to pose a serious threat to human life (including those of
                security guards) must also be assigned a high confidentiality impact. [Security
                management information associated with some Federal government assets is classified.
                The classified information is national security related and is outside the scope of
                this guideline.] Other security management information, such as that affecting
                Nuclear Regulatory Commission “SAFEGUARDS” or Internal Revenue Service “Limited For
                Official Use Only” information is not national security information, but must be

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of travel
                information on the abilities of responsible agencies to plan, prepare, and monitor
                business related travel for the organization’s employees. Generally, the
                consequences of unauthorized disclosure of the majority of travel information will
                result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
                individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination:
                Unauthorized disclosure of employee identification information coupled with credit
                information (e.g., name, social security number, credit card number) can result in
                moderate to serious consequences for individuals and local organizations. The
                Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal
                Identity and Authentication information type. Unauthorized disclosure of information
                concerning carrier/provider contract negotiations can have significant financial or
                legal consequences and put an agency at a serious disadvantage. Also, severe
                consequences may result from unauthorized disclosure of information regarding
                leadership travel plans that might jeopardize personnel security or the
                confidentiality of sensitive operations plans. In the most sensitive cases, the
                confidentiality impact level may be high.</p>

        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data

                information partially depends on the urgency with which the information is normally
                needed and the consequences of aborted or modified travel. In the case of travel
                planning information, the effects of such modifications are generally limited with
                respect to agency mission capabilities or assets. There may be scenarios in which
                integrity compromise of travel information may expose Federal leadership to harm or
                endanger a sensitive or critical operation. However, most such scenarios are dealt

                Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some asset and liability management
                information for programs that process high-impact information can assist some
                criminals to evade enforcement activities. Examples range from tax evasion resulting

            <p>Accounting entails accounting for assets, liabilities, fund balances, revenues and
                expenses associated with the maintenance of Federal funds and expenditure of Federal
                appropriations (Salaries and Expenses, Operation and Maintenance, Procurement,
                Working Capital, Trust Funds, etc.), in accordance with applicable Federal standards
                (FASAB, Treasury, OMB, GAO, etc.).</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                accounting information on the abilities of government agencies to maintain Federal
                funds and expenditure of Federal appropriations in accordance with applicable
                Federal standards. Unauthorized disclosure of accounting information for programs
                that process classified or high-impact information can give adversaries damaging
                insights into details of agency plans, priorities, and operations. In most cases,
                unauthorized disclosure of accounting information will have only a limited adverse
                effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. (Classified programs and
                systems are outside the scope of this guideline.) Special Factors Affecting
                Confidentiality Impact Determination: In relatively rare cases, actions taken based
                on unauthorized disclosure of accounting details can pose a threat to human life or
                a loss of major assets, so the confidentiality impact would be high. In some cases,
                unauthorized disclosure of accounting information can violate proprietary
                information or other non-disclosure agreements. In such cases, the government may
                suffer not only a loss of public confidence, but may become vulnerable to legal
                actions. Where sensitive or proprietary information is involved, the impact of
                unauthorized disclosure is likely to be moderate. Where the accounting information
                is involved in an audit associated with suspected fraud or other criminal
                activities, the investigation may be imperiled. Here too, the impact of unauthorized
                disclosure is likely to be moderate.</p>

            <p>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for accounting information
                is low.</p>
        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the
                accounting information. Accounting processes are generally tolerant of delay.
                Typically, disruption of access to accounting information can be expected to have
                only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
                individuals.</p>

                information. Accounting activities are not generally time-critical. An accumulation
                of small changes to data or deletion of small entries can result in cost overruns
                and other cases of excessive obligations or disbursements. In most cases, the
                adverse effects of consequent negative publicity and institution of corrective
                action programs on mission functions and public confidence in the agency can be
                serious. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In some cases,
                undetected integrity compromises can be extremely expensive to the government and
                its employees in terms of both monetary losses and loss of reputation.</p>

        <title>Payments</title>
        <description>
            <p>Payments include disbursements of Federal funds, via a variety of mechanisms, to
                Federal and private individuals, Federal agencies, state, local and international
                Governments, and the private sector, to effect payment for goods and services, or
                distribute entitlements, benefits, grants, subsidies, loans, or claims. Payment
                management provides appropriate control over all payments made by or on behalf of an
                organization, including but not limited to payments made to: vendors in accordance
                with contracts, purchase orders and other obligating documents; state governments
                under a variety of programs; employees for salaries and expense reimbursements;
                other Federal agencies for reimbursable work performed; individual citizens
                receiving Federal benefits; and recipients of Federal loans.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of payments
                information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide appropriate control
                over all payments made by or on behalf of an organization. In most cases,
                unauthorized disclosure of payments information will have only a limited adverse
                effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting
                Confidentiality Impact Determination: Payment information typically includes
                information needed for electronic payments such as bank account numbers.
                Unauthorized access to this type of information could result in significant
                financial loss for both the Federal government and its payees. Where payment
                activities are part of an agency’s service delivery mission (e.g., payment of
                benefits), Privacy Act information and other information subject to statutory or
                regulatory dissemination controls must appear in the payment vehicles (e.g., name
                and social security number on check records). (The provisional impact levels for
                personnel information are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication,
                Income, Representative Payee, and Entitlement Event information types.) In such
                cases, the confidentiality impact level can be at least moderate. (See C.2.8.8.)</p>

        <description>
            <p>Cost Accounting / Performance Measurement is the process of accumulating, measuring,
                analyzing, interpreting, and reporting cost information useful to both internal and
                external groups concerned with the way in which an organization uses, accounts for,
                safeguards, and controls its resources to meet its objectives. Cost accounting
                information is necessary in establishing strategic goals, measuring service efforts
                and accomplishments, and relating efforts to accomplishments. Also, cost accounting,
                financial accounting, and budgetary accounting all draw information from common data
                sources.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of HR
                strategy information on the ability of responsible agencies to develop effective
                human capital management strategies to ensure federal organizations are able to

                disclosure of the majority of HR strategy information will result in a limited
                adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors
                Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where more sensitive information is
                involved, it will probably be personal information subject to the Privacy Act of
                1974, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or other laws
                and executive orders affecting the dissemination of information regarding

                strategy information could be serious. In such cases, the confidentiality impact
                level might be moderate. In a few cases (e.g., where some employees are potential
                targets for retaliation by criminal elements or targets of foreign intelligence
                organizations), unauthorized disclosure of some HR strategy information (e.g.,
                succession plans, names, addresses, title, organization, dependents’ information)
                can have life-threatening consequences and has a high confidentiality impact

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of goods
                acquisition information on the ability of agencies to procure physical goods,
                products, and capital assets to be used by the Federal government. The consequences
                of unauthorized disclosure of most goods acquisition information will have only a
                limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special
                Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of
                information associated with large procurements can result in fraud, waste, abuse,
                and/or legal proceedings that can have a serious to severe effect on Federal
                government assets and operations. Also, information associated with acquisition of
                many Federal government facilities can be useful to criminals seeking to gain access
                to those facilities. In these cases, unauthorized disclosure of information can have
                a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. The
                consequent confidentiality impact would range from moderate to high. Also,
                unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s goods acquisition information by another
                agency could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within
                the goods acquisition infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations
                tasked with acquisition of government facilities and supplies. Additionally, some
                procurement information associated with proposals is proprietary. In the case of
                competitive procurements, much information associated with unsuccessful bids remains
                proprietary following award of the contract (e.g., pricing information).
                Unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information can have serious consequences for
                agencies and have at least a moderate confidentiality impact level. Some procurement
                information is classified. The classified information is national security related
                and is outside the scope of this guideline.</p>

        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to the
                goods acquisition information. Functions and processes supported by most goods
                acquisition information are tolerant of delays i.e., the data supporting the
                functions/processes are not time-critical. Typically, disruption of access will have
                a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions and
                public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                inventory control information on the ability of agencies to track information
                related to procured assets and resources with regards to quantity, quality, and
                location. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most inventory control
                information are likely to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations,
                agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact
                Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of information associated with inventories of
                hazardous materials (e.g., radioactive materials, toxins, bio-hazardous items,
                explosives) can facilitate terrorist or other criminal activities that may result in
                serious effects on Federal government assets and operations and on the general
                public. In general, inventory control information can be of material use to
                criminals seeking to perpetrate fraud, theft, or some other criminal enterprise. In
                these cases too, unauthorized disclosure of information can have a serious adverse
                effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. The consequent
                confidentiality impact of these types of criminal exploitation of unauthorized
                disclosure of inventory control information would range from moderate to high. Also,
                unauthorized disclosure of one agency’s inventory control information by another
                agency could result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within
                the inventory control infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations
                tasked with the distribution and accounting of government facilities and supplies.

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                logistics management information on the ability of agencies to plan and track the
                availability and location of personnel and their resources. The consequences of
                unauthorized disclosure of most logistics management information are likely to have
                only limited adverse effects on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
                Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized
                disclosure of logistics information associated with homeland security, law
                enforcement and some transportation activities (e.g., air transport) can facilitate
                terrorist or other criminal activities that may result in serious on Federal
                government assets and operations and on the general public. Logistics management
                information associated with a broad range of mission areas can be of material use to
                criminals seeking to perpetrate fraud, theft, or other criminal enterprises. Also,
                this information is a key intelligence target for those seeking information on
                defense or law enforcement capabilities, dispositions and intent. In all these
                cases, the unauthorized disclosure of logistics management information may result in
                serious adverse effects on agency operations, agency assets, and individuals.
                Therefore, the confidentiality impact level for these types of criminal exploitation
                of unauthorized disclosure of logistics management information will range from
                moderate to high. Some logistics management information is classified (e.g., some

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of services
                acquisition information on the ability of agencies to oversee and/or manage
                contractors and service providers from the private sector. The consequences of
                unauthorized disclosure of most services acquisition information are likely to have
                only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
                Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized
                disclosure of information associated with very large procurements can result in
                fraud, waste, abuse, and/or legal proceedings that can have a serious effect on
                Federal government assets and operations. Also, information associated with
                acquisition of some services (e.g., security or protection services) can be of
                material use to criminals seeking to gain access to Federal facilities or
                information in order to facilitate or perpetrate sabotage, murder, fraud, theft, or
                other criminal enterprises. In these cases, unauthorized disclosure of information
                can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, and/or
                individuals. The consequent confidentiality impact will range from moderate to high.
                Additionally, some procurement information associated with proposals is proprietary.
                In the case of competitive procurements, much information associated with
                unsuccessful bids remains proprietary following award of the contract (e.g., pricing
                information). Unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information can have serious
                consequences for agencies and have at least a moderate confidentiality impact level.
                Some services procurement information is classified. The classified information is

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                lifecycle/change management information on the ability of responsible agencies to
                execute processes that facilitate a smooth evolution, composition, and workforce
                transition of the design and implementation of changes to agency resources such as
                assets, methodologies, systems, or procedures. Special Factors Affecting
                Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some
                lifecycle/change management information can provide adversaries with intelligence
                information that may be useful in efforts to compromise the system. This can result
                in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information. Additionally, there
                are legislative mandates prohibiting unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets. Trade
                secrets will generally be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact level.</p>

                lifecycle/change management information. Functions and processes supported by most
                lifecycle/change management information are not time-critical. That is, temporary
                disruption of access to lifecycle/change management information will usually have
                only a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions and

        <title>IT Infrastructure Maintenance</title>
        <description>
            <p>IT infrastructure maintenance involves the planning, design, implementation, and
                maintenance of an IT Infrastructure to effectively support automated needs (i.e.
                operating systems, applications software, platforms, networks, servers, printers,
                etc.). IT infrastructure maintenance also includes information systems configuration
                and security policy enforcement information. This information includes password
                files, network access rules and implementing files and/or switch setting, hardware
                and software configuration settings, and documentation that may affect access to the
                information system’s data, programs, and/or processes. The impact levels associated
                with IT infrastructure maintenance information are primarily a function of the
                information processed in and through that infrastructure. The IT Maintenance
                Information type represents a complex set of data elements that are used to secure
                the design, implementation, and maintenance of systems and networks. The security of
                each of these data elements is dependent on the security of the other data elements.
                Security compromise of one data element type will propagate to others.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of IT
                infrastructure maintenance information on the ability of responsible agencies to
                plan, design, implement, and maintain an IT Infrastructure to effectively support
                automated needs (i.e. operating systems, applications software, platforms, networks,
                servers, printers, etc.). [See also Appendices C.3.5.5, IT Security Information and
                C.3.5.7, Information Management Information.] IT infrastructure maintenance also
                includes information systems configuration and security policy enforcement
                information. Unauthorized disclosure of some IT infrastructure maintenance
                information can lead to confidentiality compromise of information processed by the
                system (e.g., password files, file access tables, cryptographic keying information,
                network access rules, and hardware and software configuration settings, and
                documentation that may affect access to the information system’s data, programs,
                and/or processes). As a result, the confidentiality impact associated with this
                information is that of the highest impact information processed by the system. Also,
                a higher confidentiality impact may be associated with information in aggregate than
                is associated with any single element of information.</p>
        </confidentiality-explanation>
        <confidentiality-recommendation>
            <p>Particularly in the case of passwords and cryptographic keys, the provisional impact
                level recommended for IT infrastructure maintenance information depends on the
                sensitivity and criticality of system information and processes. Although an
                individual organization’s IT infrastructure maintenance information type base may
                include data elements that will require a higher rating, the recommended provisional
                impact is low.</p>
        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to IT
                infrastructure maintenance information. Functions and processes supported by most IT
                infrastructure maintenance information are not time-critical. Also, disruption of
                access will have a limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission
                functions and public confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals.
                Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Exceptions may include
                emergency response aspects of disaster management or other high load and time
                critical functions (e.g., some systems that support air traffic control functions).
                The effects of disruption of access to IT infrastructure maintenance information or
                information systems may be to deny mission-critical IT resources to all affected
                organizations. The availability impact level associated with denial-of-service to IT
                infrastructure maintenance information needed to respond to emergencies or critical
                to public safety can be high.</p>

        <availability-recommendation>
            <p>The provisional availability impact level recommended for IT infrastructure

        <integrity-explanation>
            <p>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting
                that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of
                information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of IT
                infrastructure maintenance information usually depends on the urgency with which the
                data processed in the IT infrastructure is needed or the time-critical nature of the
                data. In most cases, it is unlikely that the information will be needed urgently or
                acted upon immediately. In most cases, the consequences of unauthorized modification
                of IT infrastructure maintenance information will result in limited damage to agency
                operations or assets. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination:
                Exceptions may include incorrect information used for emergency response aspects of
                disaster management, criminal apprehension, air traffic control or other
                time-critical missions. In such cases, a moderate or high integrity impact level

        <confidentiality-explanation>
            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of record
                retention information on the ability of responsible organizations to store, track,
                account for, maintain, retrieve, and disseminate official documents and records.
                When the data being retained belongs to one of the information types described in
                this guideline, the confidentiality impact assigned the data and system is at least
                that of the highest impact information type collected. Typically, the unauthorized
                disclosure of most business management information retained will have only a limited
                adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. National security
                information and national security systems are outside the scope of this guideline.
                Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where more sensitive
                information is involved, it will most commonly be personal information subject to
                the Privacy Act of 1974 or information that is proprietary to a corporation or other
                organization. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented
                in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Such information will
                often be assigned a moderate confidentiality impact level. Where any of the
                information to be collected can reasonably be expected to have a high
                confidentiality impact level, then the record retention system must be assigned a
                high confidentiality impact level. In some cases, the impact assessment should
                consider that the aggregate of information retained might have a higher
                confidentiality impact than any individual information element.</p>

                retention information. Functions and processes supported by most record retention
                information are not time-critical. Record retention processes are generally tolerant
                of reasonable delays. In most cases, disruption of access to record retention
                information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency
                operations, agency assets, or individuals. Not many business management systems
                perform functions for which temporary loss of availability can cause significant
                degradation in mission capability, place the agency at a significant disadvantage,
                result in major damage to assets, or pose a threat to human life.</p>

                agency operations can be serious. In such cases, the integrity impact level would be
                moderate. In the case of large-scale archives or archives involving key national
                assets (e.g., national archives), the integrity impact can be particularly severe

            <p>management information on the ability of responsible agencies to perform the
                day-to-day processes of information collection, storage, dissemination, and
                destruction and managing the policies, guidelines, and standards regarding
                information management. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure depend largely
                on the content and use of the information being managed. The unauthorized disclosure
                of information management information relevant to most information managed by the
                government will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or
                individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination:
                Information collection and storage involve the day-to-day processes of gathering and
                storing data from agency programs, partners, and stakeholders. More sensitive
                information being managed is usually personal information subject to the Privacy Act
                of 1974 or information that is proprietary to a corporation or other organization.
                The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal
                Identity and Authentication information type. Such information will often be
                assigned a moderate confidentiality impact level Where any of the information to be
                managed can be expected to have a high confidentiality, impact level, then the
                information management information must be assigned a high confidentiality impact
                level. When the data being managed belongs to one of the information types described
                in this guideline, the confidentiality impact assigned to the system is that of the
                highest impact information type processed by the system. Depending on the agency and
                the mission being supported, the sensitivity of the information can range from none
                (public information) to high. (National security information and national security
                systems are outside the scope of this guideline.)</p>
        </confidentiality-explanation>
        <confidentiality-recommendation>
            <p>Particularly in the case of passwords and cryptographic keys, the provisional impact
                level recommended for information management information depends on the sensitivity
                and criticality of system information and processes. Although an individual
                organization’s IT infrastructure maintenance information type base may include data
                elements that will require a higher rating, the recommended provisional impact is
                low.</p>
        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to
                information management information. The effects of disruption of access to
                information management information may temporarily impair agency operations. The
                level of impact depends on the sensitivity of the information being managed and the
                criticality of the system to the agency mission. Except for information needed by
                real-time processes (e.g., information that feeds real-time monitoring or audit
                functions), information management processes are generally tolerant of reasonable
                delays. In most cases, disruption of access to information management information
                can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
                assets, or individuals. Not many business management systems perform functions for
                which loss of availability can cause significant degradation in mission capability,
                place the agency at a significant disadvantage, result in major damage to assets, or
                pose a threat to human life.</p>

                information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of
                information management information (e.g., configuration settings, passwords,
                authorization codes, cryptographic keying material) can compromise the effectiveness
                of the system and impair agency operations. The level of impact depends on the
                criticality of system functionality to the agency mission Special Factors Affecting
                Integrity Impact Determination: The loss of integrity for some information
                management information (e.g., encryption keys) can be very serious for agency
                operations and can have serious consequences for public confidence in the agency.
                The integrity impact level recommended for information management information
                associated with highly critical information is high.</p>

        <title>System and Network Monitoring</title>
        <description>
            <p>System and Network Monitoring supports all activities related to the real-time
                monitoring of systems and networks for optimal performance. System and network
                monitoring describes the use of tools and observation to determine the performance
                and status of information systems and is closely tied to other Information and
                Technology Management sub-functions. System and network monitoring information type
                should be considered broadly to include an agency’s network [performance, health,
                and status] and security operations [intrusion monitoring, auditing, etc.]
                support.</p>

        <confidentiality-explanation>
            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of system
                and network monitoring information on the ability of responsible agencies to perform
                the day-to-day processes of real-time monitoring of systems and networks for optimal
                performance. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure depend largely on the
                content and use of the monitoring information gathered, retained, and reported. The
                unauthorized disclosure of system and network monitoring containing architectural
                information, vulnerabilities, and availability information may have a serious
                adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors
                Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where the system and network
                monitoring information collected can be expected to have a high confidentiality
                impact level, then the system and network monitoring information must be assigned a
                high confidentiality impact level. When the system and network monitoring data being
                collected supports information types described in this guideline, agency personnel
                should consider a confidentiality impact assignment of the highest impact
                information type processed by the system. Depending on the agency and the mission
                being supported, the sensitivity of the information can range from low to high.
                (National security information and national security systems are outside the scope
                of this guideline.)</p>
        </confidentiality-explanation>
        <confidentiality-recommendation>
            <p>Particularly in the case of architectural information (IP addresses, etc.),
                vulnerabilities, and availability information, the provisional impact level
                recommended for system and network monitoring information depends on the sensitivity
                and criticality of system information and processes. The provisional confidentiality
                impact level recommended is Moderate.</p>
        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to system
                and network monitoring information. The effects of disruption of access to system
                and network monitoring information may temporarily impair or blind agency operations
                personnel from actual network and security performance. The level of impact depends
                on the sensitivity of the information and the criticality of the system to the
                agency mission. In most cases [the exception dual-fault situations], disruption of
                access to system and network monitoring information can be expected to have only a
                limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Not many
                system and network monitoring systems perform functions for which loss of
                availability can cause significant degradation in mission capability, place the
                agency at a significant disadvantage, result in major damage to assets, or pose a
                threat to human life.</p>

                and impair agency network and security operations leading to inaction or incorrect
                decisions and actions. The level of impact depends on the criticality of system

        <title>Information Sharing</title>
        <description>
            <p>The BRM provided in the FEA Consolidated Reference Model Document, Version 2.3,
                October 2007 specifies Information Sharing as relating to any method or function,
                for a given business area, facilitating: data being received in a usable medium by
                one or more departments or agencies as provided by a separate department or agency
                or other entity; and data being provided, disseminated or otherwise made available
                or accessible by one department or agency for use by one or more separate
                departments or agencies, or other entities, as appropriate. Since Information
                Sharing, as a function, is receiving and disseminating data [other information
                types] from business areas already identified, this BRM information type will not
                require its own impact assessment. Therefore, agency personnel should identify the
                information sharing information type as a pure resource management support activity
                for the evaluated information system. With the information sharing information type
                identified, agency personnel can track the flow of information to interfacing
                systems.</p>

        <title>Border and Transportation Security</title>
        <description>
            <p>Border and Transportation Security includes facilitating or deterring entry and exit
                of people, goods, and conveyances at and between U.S. ports of entry, as well as
                ensuring the security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities,
                vehicles, and personnel within the United States. Border control involves enforcing
                the laws regulating the admission of foreign-born persons (i.e., aliens) to the
                United States. This includes patrolling and monitoring borders and deportation of
                illegal aliens. Some border control information is also associated with other
                mission information types (e.g., criminal apprehension, and criminal investigation
                and surveillance information). In such cases, the impact levels of the associated
                mission information may determine impact levels associated with border control
                information. Some aspects of ensuring security of transportation and infrastructure
                networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States are also
                covered under the information types associated with the transportation mission. In
                some cases the border control information may be classified. Any classified
                information is treated under separate rules established for national security
                information.</p>

        <confidentiality-explanation>
            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of border
                control information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce laws
                regulating the admission of foreign-born persons (i.e., aliens) to the United
                States. Generally, the effects of unauthorized disclosure of border control
                information are usually confined to a single geographic region, immigration case, or
                deportation case. Even so, unauthorized disclosure may have a serious adverse effect
                on mission functions, cause significant degradation in mission capability, or place
                the agency at a significant disadvantage with respect to its border control
                responsibilities. Particularly in the case of immigration, naturalization, and
                deportation activities, unauthorized disclosure of information can violate privacy
                policies. Such unauthorized disclosures can have a serious effect on public
                confidence in the agency. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact
                Determination: Where border control information is also associated with other
                mission information types (e.g., criminal apprehension, and criminal investigation
                and surveillance information), the confidentiality impact level associated with the
                information may be high. Where unauthorized disclosure of border control information
                may put the physical safety of personnel into serious jeopardy, the confidentiality
                impact level associated with the information may be high. Unauthorized disclosure of
                confidentiality of information associated with ensuring security of transportation
                and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United
                States can result in facilitation of terrorist activities that endanger human life.
                In some cases, the consequent threat to critical infrastructures, key national
                assets, and human life can be catastrophic. Consequently, the confidentiality impact
                level associated with information associated with ensuring security of
                transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel
                within the United States is normally high</p>
        </confidentiality-explanation>
        <confidentiality-recommendation>
            <p>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for most border control
                information is moderate.</p>
        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to border
                control information. Functions and processes supported by most border control
                information are not time-critical. Also, disruption of access will have only a
                limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions and public
                confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting
                Availability Impact Determination: There may be time critical cases, for example,
                information regarding transport of illegal aliens or information about a physical
                threat posed by aliens that border control personnel have been assigned to
                interdict. In such cased, the availability impact will be high. The consequences of
                disruption of access to information or information systems associated with ensuring
                security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and
                personnel within the United States may be severe. Also, anti-terrorism missions are
                not reliably tolerant of delays. The availability impact level for information
                systems that ensure the security of transportation and infrastructure networks,
                facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States is high.</p>
        </availability-explanation>
        <availability-recommendation>
            <p>Except for such time-critical cases, cases where impact is driven by information
                shared with associated missions (e.g., anti-terrorism), the provisional availability
                impact level recommended for border control information is normally moderate.</p>
        </availability-recommendation>
        <integrity-explanation>
            <p>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting
                that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of
                information. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting
                external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect
                operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would
                usually be limited. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of
                information can be very serious if the information is critical to tactical

                modification or destruction of information associated with ensuring security of
                transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel
                within the United States may seriously affect mission operations or result in the
                loss of human life. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information
                affecting anti-terrorism information may adversely affect mission operations in a
                manner that results in unacceptable damage to critical infrastructures and/or key
                national assets or loss of key national assets and/or human life. Consequently, the

        <description>
            <p>Key Asset and Critical Infrastructure Protection involves assessing key asset and
                critical infrastructure vulnerabilities and taking direct action to mitigate
                vulnerabilities, enhance security, and ensure continuity and necessary redundancy in
                government operations and personnel. The Critical Infrastructure Information
                Protection Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 131-134) places specific controls on the
                dissemination of critical infrastructure information (see Volume I, 3.5.2.3). Under
                the provisions of Executive Order 13292, some anti-terrorism information is subject
                to security classification. National security information is outside the scope of
                this guideline.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level associated with the executive information type is
                associated with functions of the Executive Office of the President (EOP). The
                effects of loss of confidentiality of policies and guidance during the formative
                stage can result in attempts by affected entities and other interested parties to
                influence and/or impede the policy and guidance development process. Premature
                public release of formative policies and guidance before internal coordination and
                review can result in unnecessary damage to public confidence in the EOP. These
                consequences may occur when the release includes unedited internal commentary and
                discussion. Most of the information processed in and by the EOP is classified
                national security information and is outside the scope of this guideline. Other
                information processed by the EOP is extremely sensitive and applicable to homeland
                security and law enforcement. The unauthorized disclosure of this extremely
                sensitive information can seriously imperil human life, key national assets, and

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of disaster
                monitoring and prediction information on the ability of responsible agencies to
                predict when and where a disaster may take place and communicate that information to
                affected parties. The purpose of disaster monitoring and prediction activities is
                generally to disseminate information. Sharing of raw information by a diverse group
                of analysts often improves the quality of predictive analysis. Special Factors
                Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized
                disclosure of some disaster monitoring and prediction information may include public
                panic or other responses that jeopardize public safety, disaster prevention,
                emergency response, disaster repair, or restoration missions. For example, attempts
                of large populations to evacuate in an endangered area before necessary preparations
                are made for evacuation routes can result in a clogging of the routes and failure to
                evacuate large parts of the population in time to save them from a life-threatening
                event. Most of the disaster monitoring and prediction information is critical in
                terms of potential loss of human life and major property damage. The unauthorized
                release of this information may interfere with disaster prevention or emergency
                response missions. The confidentiality impact level recommended for the information
                cited in the example can be moderate or high. The unauthorized disclosure of
                disaster monitoring and prediction information to terrorists may reveal weak or
                sensitive points to target, the most effective technique(s use in attacking a
                target, and information regarding the status, intent, and plans of our adversaries.
                Where unauthorized disclosure of disaster monitoring and prediction information is
                expected to be of direct use to terrorists, the confidentiality impact level is
                recommended to be high.</p>

        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data

                monitoring and prediction information. Generally, missions supported by disaster
                monitoring and prediction information are not reliably tolerant of delays. Delays
                may cost lives and irreplaceable property, e.g., degradation in mission capability
                and resultant catastrophic consequences for critical infrastructures, key national
                assets, and/or human life. For example, a loss of availability of information that
                prevents timely and accurate dissemination of tsunami and earthquake predictions can

        <description>
            <p>Disaster preparedness and planning involves the development of response programs to
                be used in case of a disaster. This involves the development of emergency management
                programs and activities as well as staffing and equipping regional response
                centers.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of disaster
                preparedness and planning information on the ability of responsible agencies to
                develop response programs to be used in case of a disaster. This involves the
                development of emergency management programs and activities as well as staffing and
                equipping regional response centers. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of
                most disaster preparedness and planning information would have, at most, a limited
                adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors
                Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The consequences of unauthorized
                disclosure of some disaster preparedness and planning information may include
                revealing weak or sensitive critical infrastructure characteristics or inadequate
                security of U.S. targets to terrorists or other adversaries. Such information may
                reveal to an enemy the most effective technique(s) to use in attacking a target,
                and/or information regarding the capabilities, intent, and plans of our adversaries.
                Where unauthorized disclosure of disaster preparedness and planning information
                associated with critical infrastructures, large groups of people, or key national
                assets is expected to be of direct use to terrorists, the confidentiality impact
                level is recommended to be high.</p>

        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to disaster
                preparedness and planning information. Generally, missions supported by disaster
                preparedness and planning information are not reliably tolerant of delays. Special
                Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: If emergency responders and
                those responsible for repair and restoration activities are unable to access
                preparedness and planning information in the event of an actual emergency the
                consequences may include confusion and delays. In such cases, the availability

                disaster preparedness and planning information depend on whether the information is
                time-critical. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination:
                Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external
                communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations
                and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission will usually
                be limited. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of
                information can be very serious or catastrophic if the data is time-critical
                operational information. In such cases, the impact level assigned would be moderate

        <description>
            <p>Emergency Response involves the immediate actions taken to respond to a disaster
                (e.g., wildfire management). These actions include providing mobile
                telecommunications, operational support, power generation, search and rescue, and
                medical life saving actions. Impacts to emergency response information and the

                result in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the critical
                emergency services infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations
                tasked with emergency response missions.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                emergency response information on the ability of responsible agencies to respond to
                a disaster. These actions include providing mobile telecommunications, operational
                support, power generation, search and rescue, and medical life saving actions. The
                consequences of unauthorized disclosure of emergency response information will
                usually have little or no adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
                individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In
                cases where an attack is underway, unauthorized disclosure of emergency response
                information can provide information that might permit terrorists or other
                adversaries to target emergency response assets, thus jeopardizing emergency
                response resources and missions and public safety. Given the criticality that much
                emergency response information has in terms of potential loss of human life and
                major property damage, where unauthorized release of information can reasonably be
                expected to facilitate interference with emergency response missions, the
                confidentiality impact level may be moderate or high. The unauthorized disclosure of
                one agency’s emergency response by another agency could result in negative impacts
                on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the critical emergency services
                infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked with emergency
                response missions.</p>

                consulates, and other posts; ongoing membership in international organizations; the
                development of cooperative frameworks to improve relations with other Nations; and
                the development of treaties and agreements. Conflict resolution involves the
                mitigation and prevention of disputes stemming from inter and intra-state
                disagreements. Some conflict resolution information is subject to security
                classification. This classified information is treated under separate rules
                established for national security information and is outside the scope of this
                guideline. Treaties and agreements involves the negotiation and implementation of
                accords with foreign governments and organizations in efforts related to arms
                reduction and regulation, trade matters, criminal investigations and extraditions,
                and other various types of foreign policy. When treaties and agreements information
                affects intelligence gathering and/or law enforcement cooperation, impacts to such
                information and the information systems that process and store the information could
                result in negative impacts on protection of a broad range of critical
                infrastructures and key national assets. Some information associated with treaties

                resolution information on the ability of responsible agencies to mitigate and
                prevent disputes stemming from inter and intra-state disagreements. Unauthorized
                disclosure of conflict resolution information can reasonably be expected to
                jeopardize fulfillment of conflict resolution missions. This is particularly true of
                premature release of resolution factors, personnel profiles, and proposed solutions
                to adversaries. Some information that has supported a conflict resolution process
                may undo the results of successful conflict resolution processes. The loss of public
                confidence in the agency may cause a catastrophic adverse effect on an agency’s
                mission capability. Where information includes candid opinions of agency personnel,
                or involvement of agency personnel in specific prior activities, the effectiveness
                of those personnel for many future agency missions may be permanently impaired. The
                consequences of failed conflict resolution activities may pose threats to human life
                and major property assets The level of confidentiality impact assigned to treaties
                and agreements information is determined by the ability of responsible agencies to
                negotiate and implement accords with foreign governments and organizations in
                efforts related to arms reduction and regulation, trade matters, criminal
                investigations and extraditions, and other types of foreign policy. Unauthorized
                disclosure of information associated with treaties and agreements can reasonably be
                expected to prevent successful negotiation and/or ratification of treaties and
                agreements. This is particularly true of prematurely released resolution factors,
                personality assessments, and proposed solutions to adversaries. Some information
                that has supported a treaty or other international agreement process may undo the
                results of a successfully completed treaty or agreement. The subsequent threat to
                public confidence in the agency can cause a catastrophic adverse effect on an
                agency’s mission capability. When the disclosed information includes candid opinions
                of agency personnel, or background information on agency personnel, the
                effectiveness of those personnel for future agency missions may be permanently
                impaired. The consequences of failure to successfully conclude treaties and other

                The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of information
                associated with treaties and agreements also depend on the time-critical nature of

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                international development and humanitarian aid information on the ability of
                responsible agencies to execute programs relating to debt relief, foreign
                investments, poverty alleviation and food relief, foreign market expansion, and
                donations, as well as the establishment of policies and procedures to facilitate
                economic development. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact
                Determination: The unauthorized disclosure of international development and
                humanitarian aid information may not directly jeopardize foreign socio-economic and
                political development missions. However, the premature disclosure of this
                information may adversely affect agency credibility or give unfair competitive
                advantages to some candidates for mission support activities. These secondary
                effects may have a negative effect on the intended beneficiaries and can result, in
                extreme cases, in threats to human life, major assets, or the ability of the agency
                to perform future missions. Some information that has supported an international
                development and humanitarian aid process can even undo the results of previously
                completed foreign socio-economic and political development processes. Where there is
                a possibility of catastrophic consequences such as threats to human life and major
                property assets, a high confidentiality impact level must be assigned.</p>

        <confidentiality-recommendation>
            <p>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for international
                development and humanitarian aid information is moderate.</p>
        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to
                international development and humanitarian aid information. Special Factors
                Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Generally, international development
                and humanitarian aid missions are tolerant of delays. Where this is not the case,
                the availability impact associated with international development and humanitarian
                aid information may be moderate or high.</p>

                information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of
                international development and humanitarian aid information depend on whether the
                information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of
                information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may
                adversely affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage
                to the mission would usually be limited. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact
                Determination: The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of
                information can be very serious or catastrophic if the modification is to
                time-critical operational information. In such cases, the impact level assigned

        <description>
            <p>Global Trade refers to those activities the Federal Government undertakes to advance
                worldwide economic prosperity by increasing trade through the opening of overseas
                markets and freeing the flow of goods, services, and capital. Trade encompasses all
                activities associated with the importing and exporting of goods to and from the
                United States. This includes goods declaration, fee payments, and delivery/shipment
                authorization. Export promotion involves the development of opportunities for the
                expansion of U.S. exports. Merchandise inspection includes the verification of goods
                and merchandise as well as the surveillance, interdiction, and investigation of
                imports/exports in violation of various Customs laws. Tariffs/quotas monitoring
                refers to the monitoring and modification of the schedules of items imported and
                exported to and from the United States.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of export
                promotion information on the ability of responsible agencies to advance worldwide
                economic prosperity by increasing trade through the opening of overseas markets and
                freeing the flow of goods, services, and capital. Also, the confidentiality impact
                level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of merchandise inspection information
                on the ability of responsible agencies to accurately determine, report, and record
                the discovered status of imported or exported merchandise as it bears on violations
                of various Customs laws. Generally, the unauthorized disclosure of merchandise
                inspection information will not jeopardize the completion of other merchandise
                inspection missions, as shipment status is generally information of public record.
                The confidentiality impact level is also the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                tariffs/quotas monitoring information on the ability of responsible agencies to
                enforce various Customs laws, and preserve statistical data concerning the
                historical compliance with such laws. Typically, the unauthorized disclosure of
                tariffs/quotas monitoring information will not jeopardize the completion of other
                tariffs/quotas monitoring missions because the information is publicly available.
                Unauthorized disclosure of information that has supported an export promotion
                process may undo the results of successful export promotion processes. The
                consequent threat to agency image or reputations can cause a catastrophic adverse
                effect on an agency’s mission capability. Consequently, the general confidentiality
                impact level associated with export promotion information is high. Some information
                that has supported a tariffs/quotas monitoring process might be of higher
                sensitivity, such as intelligence information36 that might point to a dumping
                situation. The unauthorized disclosure of this information might jeopardize the
                success of future tariffs/quotas monitoring processes. Consequently, the
                confidentiality impact level associated with tariffs/quotas monitoring information
                is high. Intelligence information is included in national security systems. National
                security information and national security systems are outside the scope of this
                guideline. Some information that has supported a merchandise inspection process
                might be of higher sensitivity. The unauthorized disclosure of this information
                might jeopardize the success of future merchandise inspection processes. The
                consequent threat to agency image or reputations may cause a serious adverse effect
                on an agency’s mission capability. Consequently, the general confidentiality impact
                level associated with merchandise inspection information is high.</p>

        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to global
                trade information. Export promotion and merchandise inspection missions are
                generally tolerant of significant delays. If the export promotion and merchandise
                inspection information are time-critical, the availability impact may be high. This
                would be the case where such an occurrence could result in significant financial
                consequences as a result of uncertainty regarding the status of an imported or
                exported shipment. Tariffs/quotas monitoring missions are also tolerant of
                significant delays. Typically, this information is used in high level policy and
                strategic analysis, and denial of access might cause an inconvenience but no
                significant mission impact. However, the availability impact associated with
                tariffs/quotas monitoring information may be high, if denial of access could result
                in serious damage to the image or reputation of an agency resulting from uncertainty
                regarding the compliance statistics of a major sovereign trade partner.</p>

                trade information depends on whether the information is time-critical. Unauthorized
                modification or destruction of information affecting export promotion information
                may adversely affect mission operations and result in potentially serious economic
                repercussions. Trade agreements that have been implemented are generally matters of
                public record. Therefore, the specific negotiated terms, etc., must be accurately
                recorded. The modification of merchandise inspection information may result in
                significant financial consequences to an importer or exporter whose shipment is in
                question and may adversely affect mission operations and result in potentially
                serious economic repercussions. The results of completed inspections are matters of
                public record and must be accurately recorded. For tariffs/quotas monitoring
                information, the requirement for adequate means to detect data corruption is high.
                This information is used in policy and strategic analysis, and the accuracy of this
                statistical information is critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of
                information affecting tariffs/quotas monitoring information may adversely affect

        <title>Recreational Resource Management and Tourism</title>
        <description>
            <p>Recreational Resource Management and Tourism involves the management of national
                parks, monuments, and tourist attractions as well as visitor centers, campsites, and
                park service facilities. Impacts to some information and information systems
                associated with tourism management may affect the security of some key national
                assets (e.g., some national monuments and icons).</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                recreational resource management and tourism information on the ability of
                responsible agencies to manage national parks, monuments, and tourist attractions as
                well as visitor centers, campsites, and park service facilities. The consequences of
                unauthorized disclosure of most recreational resource management and tourism
                information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
                or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination:
                Recreational resource management and tourism include enforcement functions (e.g.,
                protective and enforcement functions of the National Park Service). Confidentiality
                impacts associated with criminal apprehension, criminal investigation and
                surveillance, citizen protection, and property protection may cause the
                confidentiality impact of enforcement-related information to be moderate or high.
                The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of property and tourist protection
                information can be particularly severe in the case of protection of national
                monuments and icons.</p>
        </confidentiality-explanation>
        <confidentiality-recommendation>
            <p>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for most recreational
                resource management and tourism information is low.</p>
        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to
                recreational resource management and tourism information. Generally, missions
                supported by recreational resource management and tourism information are tolerant
                of delays. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Recreational
                resource management and tourism include enforcement functions (e.g., protective and
                enforcement functions of the National Park Service). Availability impacts associated
                with criminal apprehension, criminal investigation and surveillance, citizen
                protection, and property protection may cause the confidentiality impact of
                enforcement-related information to be moderate or high. There may also be
                time-critical cases associated with protection of people and key national assets
                from natural disasters (such as fires, unexpected blizzards, or volcanic eruptions).
                In such cased, the availability impact may be high. Except for time-critical
                information, the availability impact level recommended for protection-related
                information is typically moderate.</p>
        </availability-explanation>
        <availability-recommendation>
            <p>Most recreational resource management and tourism information is routine in nature
                (not time-critical). Consequently, the provisional availability impact level
                recommended for most recreational resource management and tourism information is
                low.</p>
        </availability-recommendation>
        <integrity-explanation>
            <p>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting
                that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of
                information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of
                recreational resource management and tourism information depends on whether the
                information is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of
                information affecting external communications associated with recreational resource
                management and tourism information (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely
                affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the
                mission would usually be limited. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact
                Determination: Recreational resource management and tourism include enforcement
                functions (e.g., protective and enforcement functions of the National Park Service).
                Integrity impacts associated with criminal apprehension, criminal investigation and
                surveillance, citizen protection, and property protection may cause the integrity
                impact of enforcement-related information to be moderate or high. These types of
                enforcement-related information are time-critical. Where terrorists or other
                criminals pose a threat to key national assets, or pose a threat to human life, the
                integrity impact level recommended for recreational resource management and tourism
                enforcement information is high.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                agricultural innovation and service information on the ability of responsible
                agencies to create and disseminate of better methods for farming and the development
                of better and healthier crops. In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of
                agricultural innovation and service information will have only a limited adverse
                effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting
                Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases, unauthorized disclosure of
                preliminary findings or policies under consideration regarding proposed agricultural
                products may result in domestic or international public relations problems for the
                Federal government. In such cases, serious damage can result for agricultural
                innovation and service operations. Here, the confidentiality impact level may be
                moderate. In other cases, unauthorized disclosure of information regarding creation,
                storage, and transportation of dangerous plant disease vectors, animal disease
                vectors, pesticides, and herbicides might facilitate malicious activities by
                terrorists or other criminals. Here, there is a potential for loss of human life, so
                the confidentiality impact level may be high.</p>

        <title>Energy Supply</title>
        <description>
            <p>Energy Supply involves all activities devoted to ensuring the availability of an
                adequate supply of energy for the United States and its citizens. Energy Supply
                includes the sale and transportation of commodity fuels such as coal, oil, natural
                gas, and radioactive materials. This function also includes distributing and
                transferring power, electric generation, and/or storage located near the point of
                use. Impacts to some information and information systems associated with energy
                supply may affect the security of critical infrastructures, particularly in the
                areas of energy transmission and transport.</p>

        <confidentiality-explanation>
            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of energy
                supply information on the ability of responsible agencies to conduct activities
                related to the sale and transportation of commodity fuels such as coal, oil, natural
                gas, and radioactive materials. This function also includes distributing and
                transferring power, electric generation, and/or storage located near the point of
                use. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external
                communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect operations
                and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would usually
                be limited. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The
                consequences of unauthorized disclosure of energy supply information can have a
                serious economic impact with respect to competitive advantages and financial and
                commodity market dynamics. Also, the unauthorized disclosure of supply information
                may assist terrorists in the theft of energy products or disruption of energy
                distribution channels. Facilitation of theft of nuclear materials is a particularly
                catastrophic potential result of unauthorized disclosure of specific types of energy
                supply information. In these cases, the confidentiality impact must be considered to
                be high. [Some information regarding transportation and storage of nuclear materials
                is classified. The classified information is national security related and is
                outside the scope of this guideline. Other information, such as Nuclear Regulatory
                Commission “SAFEGUARDS” information is not national security information, but must
                be treated as having high confidentiality impact.] With respect to possible use by
                terrorists of energy distribution information regarding petroleum, natural gas, and
                other flammable or explosive products, a realistic impact assessment must include
                energy distribution information from private companies. This information is also
                susceptible to access by terrorists. Where distribution of hazardous energy products
                is involved, there is a potential unauthorized disclosure consequence of loss of
                human life and major property. In such cases the confidentiality impact level can be
                moderate or high. [Disclosure of transportation routes and storage facilities is
                often (i) both authorized and necessary to mission accomplishment and (ii)
                authorized, or even mandated, for public safety reasons.] Also, the unauthorized
                disclosure of one agency’s energy supply information by another agency could result
                in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the energy
                distribution infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked
                with energy supply.</p>
        </confidentiality-explanation>
        <confidentiality-recommendation>
            <p>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for most energy supply
                information is low.</p>
        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to energy
                supply information. Typically, disruption of access will have a limited adverse
                effect on agency operations (including mission, functions, or public confidence in
                the agency), agency assets, or individuals. Also, most energy supply information is
                not time-critical. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination:
                Mission-critical systems: Functions supported by mission-critical information or
                information systems (e.g., electrical power generation, transmission, and/or
                distribution; petroleum or gas pipelines) are often adversely impacted by lack of
                availability. Loss of availability of the information or information system can
                result in severe impacts to the environment, service, major assets and/or human
                safety. Consequently, the availability impact level associated with these types of
                mission-critical processes/systems may be high. Non mission-critical systems: For
                information or information systems that do not directly impact mission-critical
                functions, the availability impact level may be downgraded to low.</p>

        <integrity-explanation>
            <p>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data and systems
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification to or

                modification to or destruction of energy supply information or information systems,
                usually depends on whether the information is mission-critical. Special Factors
                Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Mission-critical systems: Unauthorized
                modification of mission-critical information or information systems (e.g.,
                electrical power distribution, petroleum or gas pipelines) can result in severe
                impacts to the environment, service, major assets and/or human safety. Consequently,
                the integrity impact level associated with these types of mission-critical
                processes/systems may be high. Non mission-critical systems: For information or
                information systems that do not directly impact mission-critical functions, the

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of energy
                conservation and preparedness information on the ability of responsible agencies to
                protect energy resources from over-consumption to ensure the continued availability
                of fuel resources and to promote environmental protection. In most cases,
                unauthorized disclosure of energy conservation and preparedness information will
                have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals.
                Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some cases,
                unauthorized disclosure of preliminary findings or policies under consideration
                regarding proposed conservation measures or the distribution of energy in the event
                of an emergency may result in mobilization of special interests. These groups may
                successfully oppose necessary conservation measures and be given an unfair advantage
                for specific commercial interests. Also, the unauthorized disclosure may cause
                domestic or international loss of confidence in the Federal government. In such
                cases, serious damage may result for energy conservation and preparedness
                operations. Therefore, the confidentiality impact level may be moderate. In other
                cases, unauthorized disclosure of information regarding measures taken to ensure the
                provision of energy in the event of an emergency may facilitate malicious activities
                of terrorists. Here, there is a potential for loss of human life resulting from
                extended outages, so the confidentiality impact level may be high.</p>

                disclosure of trade secrets. Trade secrets will generally be assigned a moderate
                confidentiality impact level. In the case of patent activities, technical details of
                applications involving inventions with military applications and with deliberations
                concerning withholding patents as a result of national security considerations may
                be sensitive. (In some cases, the patent application information may be classified
                or to contain information concerning weapons or weapons systems. In such cases, the
                information would be national security information, and outside the scope of this
                guideline.)</p>

                monopolies, and illegal behavior. This also includes deposit protection.</p>

        <confidentiality-explanation>
            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                financial sector oversight information on the ability of responsible agencies to
                regulate private sector firms and markets (stock exchanges, corporations, etc.) to
                protect investors from fraud, monopolies, and illegal behavior. This also includes
                deposit protection, creation, regulation, and control of the nation’s currency and
                coinage supply and demand. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact
                Determination: While the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of some financial
                sector oversight information would have only a limited adverse effect on agency
                operations, agency assets, or individuals, there are significant exceptions.
                Unauthorized disclosure of much financial sector oversight information can result in
                major financial consequences. This can result in assignment of a high impact level
                to such information. In some cases, premature disclosure of regulatory information
                can impact major financial markets and damage national banking and finance
                infrastructures. For example, unauthorized disclosure of a decision to increase the
                money supply or of an ongoing securities fraud investigation can have a dramatic
                effect on financial markets. This can result in assignment of a high impact level to
                such information. Unauthorized disclosure to a single institution (e.g., a major
                banking institution or brokerage house), could damage faith in regulatory
                institutions and result in even more market disruption and have a severe or
                catastrophic adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. This can result in
                assignment of a high impact level to such information. Even where the consequences
                are limited to giving an unfair market advantage to a single financial or commercial
                institution, unauthorized disclosure can have a serious adverse effect on public
                confidence in the agency and its staff. This can result in assignment of a high
                impact level to such information.</p>

                financial sector oversight information depends on whether the information is
                time-critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting
                external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect
                operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would
                usually be limited. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Where
                unauthorized modification or destruction of financial sector oversight information
                facilitates or enables catastrophic consequences, the integrity impact level may be

                goods over land involve relatively sensitive information. These are included in Law
                Enforcement. Unauthorized disclosure of accident investigation information that has
                not yet been adequately researched, coordinated, or edited can result in serious
                economic harm to individuals and to corporations. Loss in public confidence is a
                further potential consequence. Additionally, some information associated with ground
                transportation functions is proprietary to corporations or subject to privacy laws

                levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information type.)
                In such cases, the confidentiality impact resulting from unauthorized disclosure may

                further potential consequence. Additionally, some information associated with air
                transportation functions is proprietary to corporations or subject to privacy laws.
                In such cases, the confidentiality impact resulting from unauthorized disclosure can
                be moderate. The sensitivity of air transportation information (e.g., aircraft
                positioning data)can be time or event-driven. For example, passenger lists are not
                releasable to the general public before a flight takes off, but are placed in the
                public domain in the event of a crash. In such cases, the confidentiality impact
                resulting from unauthorized disclosure can be moderate. Also, much military air
                transport information is national security information and is outside the scope of
                this guideline.</p>

            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to air
                transportation information. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact
                Determination: Some air transportation functions are time-critical (e.g., air
                traffic control instructions, position reports, situational awareness, separation,
                weather reports for the terminal area, microburst tracking, maintenance trouble
                reports). Loss of availability of time-critical information necessary to these
                functions can result in large-scale property loss and in loss of human lives. Timing
                plays a large part in the availability impact of air transportation information. For
                example, the time criticality of weather information may be measured in minutes or
                hours in the case of pre-flight and mid-flight operations. However, on final landing
                approach, up to the second availability may be required (e.g., detection of
                microbursts in the terminal area). Air operations are not tolerant of information
                loss. The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) supplements the availability of
                information available from the Department of Defense's Global Positioning Systems
                (GPS). Because of the potential system-wide impacts from a loss of availability of
                this system, it would be appropriately categorized as having a high availability
                impact. The following example illustrates the use of controls to address a high
                integrity impact level: The systems designed for command and control for air traffic
                control (e.g., the NAS systems) have been designed for robust operations. However,
                in general, loss of availability for the majority of systems does not cause
                derogation in safety. The impacts of a loss of availability (or the loss of
                availability due to the loss of integrity) include local or system-wide air traffic
                delays, diversion of traffic to alternate airports, etc., and the economic losses
                related to those delays, diversions, etc. Severe impacts are not the norm because
                the loss of availability is inevitable, and the systems have been designed to
                accommodate failures. In light of the above, the Recommended Availability Impact
                Level is moderate.</p>

            <p>The provisional availability impact level recommended for most air transportation
                information is low.</p>

        <integrity-explanation>
            <p>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting
                that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of
                information. Many air transportation functions do not process time-critical
                information. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Some air
                transportation functions are time-critical (e.g., air traffic control instructions,
                position reports, situational awareness, separation, weather reports for the
                terminal area, microburst tracking, maintenance trouble reports). Communications
                management (e.g., frequency management) information also needs to be included in air
                transportation integrity impact considerations. There may be circumstances under
                which erroneous frequency assignment information can result in a loss of
                communications with aircraft that are affected by hazardous conditions (e.g., loss
                of communications with an aircraft in a crowded air space.) Unauthorized
                modification or destruction of time-critical information necessary to these
                functions can result in large-scale property loss and in loss of human lives. The
                Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) supplements the availability and integrity of
                position information available from the DoD's Global Positioning Systems (GPS).
                Because of the potential system-wide impacts from a loss of integrity of this
                system, a high integrity impact level is recommended. The following example
                illustrates the use of controls to address a high integrity impact level: Systems
                designed for command and control for air traffic control (e.g., the NAS systems)
                have been designed for robust operations. In the NAS, integrity and availability
                issues are closely linked. The loss of integrity in a system is monitored
                continuously, and the loss of integrity is treated as a loss of availability, and in
                general, loss of availability for the majority of systems does not cause derogation
                in safety. That is, if the operational parameters for an Instrument Landing System
                are detected to be out of established tolerances, the system is immediately removed
                from service - it is powered down and users are notified that the particular service
                is not available. In most cases, a loss of availability is preferred to continued
                availability with degraded integrity. The impacts of the loss of availability due to
                the loss of integrity include system-wide air traffic delays, diversion of traffic
                to alternate airports - and the economic losses related to those delays, diversions,
                etc. Severe impacts are not the norm because the loss of availability is assumed to
                be inevitable, and the systems have been designed to accommodate failures. In light
                of the above, the Recommended Integrity Impact Level is moderate.</p>

                launches/missions of passengers or goods into space and includes commercial,
                scientific, and military operations. The protection of space operations from
                deliberate attack involves military operations (D.1), homeland security operations
                (D.2), and law enforcement operations (D.16). In most cases, unauthorized disclosure
                of space operations information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
                operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact
                Determination: Civilian space operations are intended to be conducted in the open.
                Administrative and business functions associated with space operations may involve
                proprietary, procurement-sensitive, and Privacy Act information. The Privacy Act
                Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and
                Authentication information type. In such cases, the confidentiality impact resulting
                from unauthorized disclosure can be moderate. Some information regarding space

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of access
                to care information on the ability of responsible agencies to focus on the access to
                appropriate care. This includes streamlining efforts to receive care; ensuring care
                is appropriate in terms of type, care, intensity, location and availability;
                providing seamless access to health knowledge, enrolling providers; performing
                eligibility determination, and managing patient movement will have only a limited
                adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors
                Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some information associated with
                health care involves confidential patient information subject to the Privacy Act and
                to HIPAA. The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in
                the Personal Identity and Authentication information type. Other information (e.g.,
                information proprietary to hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, insurers, and care
                givers) must be protected under rules governing proprietary information and
                procurement management. In some cases, unauthorized disclosure of this information
                such as privacy-protected medical records can have serious consequences for agency
                operations. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level may be moderate.</p>

            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to care.
                Access to care is generally tolerant of delay. Typically, disruption of access to
                care information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on agency
                operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Availability
                Impact Determination: Some access to care information could be deemed time-critical
                and is dependent on the severity of the health issue requiring immediate access to
                care, patient movements, etc.. Delays in the communication of specific situations
                may cause serious impacts to the patient or care provide. This can result in
                assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.</p>

                that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of
                information. Many activities associated with access to care information are not time
                critical and the adverse effects of unauthorized modification or destruction of
                health care information on agency mission functions and/or public confidence in the
                agency will be limited. However, the consequences of unauthorized modification or
                destruction of health care information may result in incorrect, inappropriate, or
                excessively delayed treatment of patients. In these cases, serious adverse effects
                can include legal actions and danger to human life. Unauthorized modification or

        <description>
            <p>Population Health Management and Consumer Safety assesses health indicators and
                consumer products as a means to protect and promote the health of the general
                population. This includes monitoring of health, health planning, and health
                management of humans, animals, animal products, and plants, as well as tracking the
                spread of diseases and pests. It also includes evaluation of consumer products,
                drug, and foods to assess the potential risks and dangers; education of the consumer
                and the general population; and facilitation of health promotion and disease and
                injury prevention.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                population health management and consumer safety information on the ability of
                responsible agencies to assess health indicators and consumer products as a means to
                protect and promote the health of the general population that will have only a
                limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. The basic
                nature of this information type is to support the public and consumer market with
                information and supporting education. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality
                Impact Determination: The most serious adverse effects are likely to involve
                premature release of health planning and management information, disclosure of
                sensitive mission support information [agencies’ means to combat spread of diseases
                or reacting to terrorist attacks on food, water, and other public consumables], or
                the exposure of information that is proprietary to an organization being evaluated
                by the agency [Unauthorized disclosure of some information can have serious economic
                impact on both individual companies and the broader market place. The consequences
                of such unauthorized disclosures may have an adverse effect on public confidence in
                the agency.] This can result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such
                information.</p>

            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish population health
                management and consumer safety. Population health management and consumer safety are
                generally tolerant of delay. Typically, disruption of population health management
                and consumer safety information can be expected to have only a limited adverse
                effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors
                Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Delays in the communication of product
                deficiencies or issues associated with food, plant and animal sources may be life
                threatening. Delays in agency response to public health issues involving humans,
                animals, animal products, and plants, as well as tracking the spread of diseases and
                pests may also be life threatening or significantly degrade public safety. This can
                result in assignment of a high impact level to such information.</p>

                population health management and consumer safety information can be serious if the
                public is exposed to mislabeled, tainted, or otherwise harmful food, drugs, or
                consumer products. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Impacts

                information systems associated with quality assurance of food, animal, plant and
                pharmaceuticals may affect the security of critical agriculture and food and public
                health infrastructures. Additionally, unauthorized modification or destruction of
                information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may
                adversely affect operations and public confidence in the agency and the agency
                mission. In such cases, unauthorized modification or destruction of information can
                result in loss of human life. This can result in assignment of a high impact level

                effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting
                Confidentiality Impact Determination: Some information associated with health care
                involves confidential patient information subject to the Privacy Act and to HIPAA.
                The Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal
                Identity and Authentication information type. Other information (e.g., information

                correct urgent threats to patient health, health care processes are usually tolerant
                of reasonable delays. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination:
                Some health care delivery services information is time-critical and is dependent on
                the severity of the health threat(s) and the rapidity with which the threat is

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of general
                retirement and disability information on the ability of responsible agencies to
                develop and manage retirement benefits, pensions, and income security for those who
                are retired or disabled. The consequences of limited unauthorized disclosure of
                retirement and disability information would have a limited adverse effect on agency
                operations, agency assets, or individuals. The disclosure of privacy information
                (e.g., information required by the Privacy Act of 1974 or other statutes and
                executive orders to receive special handling to protect the privacy of individuals)

                external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect
                operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission
                would usually be limited. Generally, the consequences of unauthorized modification
                or destruction of general retirement and disability information would have a limited
                adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. However, where
                provision of retirement and/or disability benefits is a primary agency service
                delivery mission, the consequences can be more severe. Special Factors Affecting

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of criminal
                apprehension information on the ability of responsible agencies to track and capture
                groups or individuals believed to be responsible for committing Federal crimes, on
                public safety, and on the safety of law enforcement officers. The consequences of
                unauthorized disclosure of criminal apprehension information depend 1) on the
                seriousness of the crime involved, 2) on the capability and predisposition of the
                criminal to injure or kill civilians or law enforcement officials, 3) timing (e.g.,
                the ability of the criminal to access the information and use it to facilitate a
                crime or evade capture), and 4) statutory and regulatory requirements which vary by
                violation. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In cases
                where 1) the crimes are not violent and do not involve large property losses, and 2)
                there is no history of violence on the part of the criminal, the confidentiality
                impact may be low or moderate. For many crimes that are the responsibility of
                Federal law enforcement agencies, the consequences associated with unauthorized
                disclosure of criminal apprehension information must often be assumed to pose a
                threat to human life or result in a loss of major assets. In such cases,
                confidentiality impact level is high.</p>
        </confidentiality-explanation>
        <confidentiality-recommendation>
            <p>For most Federal law enforcement systems that support criminal apprehension
                activities the harm that results from unauthorized disclosure will be limited.
                Therefore, the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for criminal
                apprehension information is low.</p>
        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to criminal
                apprehension information. Missions supported by criminal apprehension information
                are not typically tolerant of delay. While there are many cases in which elements of
                criminal apprehension information are not urgent, there are many in which relatively
                short periods of unavailability can pose a threat to human life and/or result in a

                information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of
                criminal apprehension information may depend on the urgency with which the
                information is needed and on the success of subsequent prosecution of the
                apprehended criminal(s). Unauthorized modification or destruction of information
                affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely
                affect operations and/or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the
                mission would usually be limited. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact
                Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal apprehension
                information may have an adverse effect on the subsequent prosecution of the
                apprehended criminal. Consequently, a serious adverse effect on agency operations
                can result. This can place the agency at a significant disadvantage. In such cases,
                the integrity impact level recommended for criminal apprehension information is at
                least moderate. When the criminal apprehension information is time-critical, the
                unauthorized modification or destruction of this information may have a severe or
                catastrophic effect on public confidence in the agency, pose a significant threat to
                major assets, and/or pose a threat to human life. This is applicable for many crimes
                that are the responsibility of Federal law enforcement agencies. For this criminal
                apprehension information, the Recommended Integrity Impact Level is high.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of criminal
                investigation and surveillance information on the ability of responsible agencies to
                collect evidence required to determine responsibility for a crime, to monitor and
                question affected parties, and to protect the safety of witnesses and law
                enforcement officers. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of criminal
                investigation and surveillance information depend 1] on the seriousness of the crime
                involved, 2] timing (e.g., the ability of the criminal39 to access the information
                and use it to facilitate a crime, to evade detection or surveillance, or eliminate
                probable cause for searches and warrants), and 3] on the capability and
                predisposition of the criminal to injure witnesses or law enforcement officials.
                Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In cases where 1)
                the crimes are not violent and do not involve large property losses, and 2) there is
                no history of violence on the part of the criminal, the confidentiality impact may
                be low or moderate. Given the nature of many of the crimes that are the
                responsibility of Federal law enforcement agencies, the consequences associated with
                unauthorized disclosure of criminal investigation and surveillance information must
                often be assumed to pose a threat to human life or result in a loss of major assets.
                Information that reveals the identity and/or location of informants may be of
                particular concern. In such cases, the confidentiality impact level is high.</p>

        <confidentiality-recommendation>
            <p>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for criminal investigation
                and surveillance information is moderate.</p>
        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to criminal
                investigation and surveillance information. Missions supported by criminal
                investigation and surveillance information are not always tolerant of delay. Special
                Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: There are some cases in which
                relatively short periods of unavailability of criminal investigation and
                surveillance information may result in lost surveillance opportunities or
                opportunities to make an arrest. Where the crimes involved pose a threat to human
                life and/or result in a loss of major assets, the availability impact level
                recommended for criminal investigation and surveillance information is high.</p>

        <availability-recommendation>
            <p>The provisional availability impact level recommended for criminal investigation and
                surveillance information is moderate.</p>
        </availability-recommendation>
        <integrity-explanation>
            <p>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting
                that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of
                information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of
                criminal investigation and surveillance information depends on the urgency with
                which the information is needed and on the success of subsequent prosecution of the
                apprehended criminal(s). Unauthorized modification or destruction of information
                affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely
                affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission
                would usually be limited. Where unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal
                investigation and surveillance information can have an adverse effect on the
                granting or execution of a search or wiretap warrant or on the success of subsequent
                prosecution of the apprehended criminal a serious adverse effect on agency
                operations can result. This can place the agency at a significant disadvantage.
                Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: In some cases, major
                investigations can be jeopardized when the time-critical criminal investigation and
                surveillance information is modified or destroyed. Where the criminal case under
                investigation involves major property losses, large-scale financial frauds that have
                serious implications for financial markets, poses a threat to key national assets or
                human life, the Recommended Integrity Impact Level is high. In international
                matters, such as trade enforcement, tariff agreements, etc., or where foreign
                nationals might be involved, the integrity impact level for criminal investigation
                and surveillance information will be high. Any compromise of such information could
                result in catastrophic adverse effects on future operations, individual and agency
                reputations, and on human life.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of citizen
                protection information on the ability of responsible agencies to protect the general
                population of the United States from criminal activity. In some cases, the criminal
                activity is terrorist activity intended to cause mass casualties. While the results
                of unauthorized disclosure of most citizen protection information are unlikely to
                have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, the exceptions can have
                catastrophic consequences. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact
                Determination: The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of citizen protection
                information could be severe. If detailed intelligence information regarding a
                planned terrorist act was disclosed, the terrorists might succeed in countering the
                protection measures and carry out a devastating attack. The confidentiality impacts
                associated with information concerning defensive dispositions would be high. While
                the adverse effects of unauthorized disclosure of some citizen protection
                information on law enforcement operations, assets, and individuals are limited; the
                stakes are usually higher. Federal citizen protection activities often seek to
                protect the public against life-threatening situations or against loss of major
                assets.</p>

                protection information. Many citizen protection missions are usually tolerant of
                reasonable delays. Most criminal activity against citizen protection information is
                not life threatening but can result in serious property loss. Special Factors
                Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Emergency situations or elevated
                terrorist threat conditions are not tolerant of delays. Where systems support
                time-sensitive operations for life-threatening situations, the availability impact

                protection information may pose a potential threat to public safety particularly if
                the protective measures are compromised. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact
                Determination: In some cases (e.g., terrorist threats), unauthorized modification or

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of property
                protection information on the ability of responsible agencies to ensure the security
                of civilian and government property. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of
                property protection information are generally dependent on the nature of the
                property being protected. Where the property being protected is neither critical to
                agency operations nor of such value that its loss would degrade mission capability
                or place the agency at a significant disadvantage, unauthorized disclosure would
                have a limited adverse effect. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact
                Determination: Where critical infrastructure facilities or key national assets are
                being protected, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of property protection
                information might reveal vulnerabilities in protection measures to terrorists or
                other adversaries. Where unauthorized disclosure of property protection information
                associated with critical infrastructures, large groups of people, or key national
                assets is expected to be of direct use to terrorists, the confidentiality impact
                level is high. Most protected facilities are not part of national security, the
                critical infrastructure, or key national asset categories. If unauthorized
                disclosure of property protection information resulted in damage to these
                facilities, serious adverse effects on agency operations and assets could reasonably
                be expected to result. This can result in assignment of a moderate or high impact
                level to such information. Where the property being protected involves classified
                information, the property protection information itself might be classified. Some

                information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of
                property protection information depends on the type of property being protected and
                on the immediacy with which the information is expected to be used. In most cases,
                unauthorized disclosure can be expected to have limited adverse consequences.
                Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized modification
                or destruction of information affecting external communications (e.g., web pages,
                electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency.
                However, the potential damage to the protection mission will usually be of greater
                concern. If the modified or destroyed information is tactical i.e., time-critical,
                there is a greater potential for actions being taken based on incomplete or false
                information. This can have serious adverse effects on protection operation. This can
                result in assignment of a moderate impact level to such information.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                substance control information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce
                legal substances (i.e., alcohol and tobacco) and illegal narcotics laws including
                trafficking, possession, sale, distribution, and other related activities.
                Unauthorized disclosure of a significant proportion of substance control information
                can compromise investigations, cause apprehension operations to fail, and compromise
                prosecutions. This can have a serious adverse effect on agency operations and place
                the agency at a significant disadvantage. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality
                Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some routine substance control
                information is unlikely to have more than a limited adverse effect on agency
                operations, agency assets, or individuals. The confidentiality impact associated
                with such information is low. Where the unauthorized disclosure of information
                exposes sensitive information sources or compromises investigative or interdiction
                operations, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of substance control
                information may have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, significantly
                degrade mission capability, and/or pose a threat to human life. Where unauthorized
                disclosure endangers investigations in process, investigative or intelligence
                information sources, or information regarding witnesses or other critical case file
                elements, the danger to human life and key agency missions can be significant. Where
                unauthorized disclosure endangers witnesses or law enforcement officers, the impact
                level must be rated as high. Other factors affecting confidentiality impacts
                associated with substance control information are discussed under Section D.16.1
                (Criminal Apprehension) and Section D.16.2 (Criminal Investigation and
                Surveillance). Some substance control information is classified (e.g., some
                intelligence-derived information). Classified information and other national
                security information are outside the scope of this guideline</p>

        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to
                substance control information. Most substance control processes are usually tolerant
                of reasonable delays. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination:
                The consequences of unavailability of information can be serious if the information
                is critical to tactical operations i.e., is time-critical. Failure of some processes
                during tactical operations can result in both threats to human life and severe harm
                to public confidence in the agency. The impact level assigned to information and
                information systems associated with these tactical processes is high.</p>

                the insider threat. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of
                information can be serious if the information is critical to tactical operations
                i.e., is time-critical. Unauthorized modification or destruction of information
                affecting external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely
                affect operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to most
                missions would usually be limited Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact
                Determination: Unauthorized modification or destruction of information (particularly
                time-critical information) affecting internal communications can jeopardize
                investigations, prosecutions, the lives of witnesses, and the safety of enforcement
                officers. In some cases, unauthorized modification or destruction of information can
                result in loss of human life. In such cased, the integrity impact level is high.
                Other factors affecting integrity impacts associated with substance control
                information are discussed under Section D.16.1 (Criminal Apprehension) and Section

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of crime
                prevention information on the ability of responsible agencies to create safer
                communities through the control and reduction of crime by addressing the causes of
                crime and reducing the opportunities of crime. Generally, the unauthorized

                on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting
                Confidentiality Impact Determination: In a few cases, details of crime prevention
                programs are sensitive (e.g., location of actively monitored surveillance cameras
                where only a fraction of camera feeds are monitored). In such cases, unauthorized
                disclosure of crime prevention information might have a serious adverse effect on
                crime prevention operations by eliminating uncertainty regarding surveillance
                patterns. Therefore, the confidentiality impact might be moderate.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of trade
                law enforcement information on the ability of responsible agencies to enforce
                various Customs laws. Unauthorized disclosure of trade law enforcement information
                could potentially jeopardize fulfillment of other trade law enforcement missions.
                Some information that has supported a trade law enforcement process might be of
                higher sensitivity, and unauthorized disclosure of this information might jeopardize
                the success of future trade law enforcement processes. The subsequent threat to
                agency image or reputation can cause a serious adverse effect on an agency’s mission
                capability. Where information includes names of informants, informant contacts, or
                agency personnel, the effectiveness of those personnel in future enforcement
                activities can be permanently impaired, or their lives threatened. Intelligence

                laws governing adversarial legal proceedings. While much information associated with
                legal defense is public, some information is sealed by the court or is otherwise
                protected from disclosure. Violation of rules regarding unauthorized disclosure is
                punishable by law, disbarment, fine, and/or imprisonment. Generally, the
                unauthorized disclosure of legal defense information will have only a limited
                adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Where unauthorized
                disclosure of information might have a serious adverse effect on legal defense,
                there is a presumption of a miscarriage of justice. If an unauthorized disclosure is
                discovered, the legal proceeding may be jeopardized (e.g., a mistrial may be
                declared). The cost to the government and others in terms of finance, time, and
                disruption to normal operations can be severe. If suspicion is raised concerning
                government complicity or negligence, serious loss of public confidence in government
                agencies or the legal process may result. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality
                Impact Determination: Where the life of a victim, witness, or informant may be
                endangered by disclosure, the confidentiality impact will be high. Also, where the
                consequences of a miscarriage of justice are likely to endanger public safety (e.g.,
                release of a terrorist or other murderer), the confidentiality impact will be
                high.</p>

                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to legal
                defense information. Most legal defense processes are tolerant of delay. Delays can
                impact court schedules, cause significant taxpayer expense, and potentially
                jeopardize legal proceedings (see C17.2.2). In most cases, disruption of access to
                legal defense information can be expected to have only a limited adverse effect on
                government operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting
                Availability Impact Determination: In exceptional cases (e.g., information affecting
                a ruling regarding an impending execution), loss of availability of information can
                have a severe adverse effect. The consequent availability impact level would be

                that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of
                information. Legal defense activities are not typically time-critical. In most
                cases, unauthorized modification or destruction of legal defense information will
                have only a limited adverse effect on government operations, government assets, or
                individuals. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: For legal
                defense information, when evidence or other defense information has been compromised
                the legal proceedings can be jeopardized. As a consequence, the cost to the
                government and other entities in terms of finance, time, and disruption to normal
                operations may be severe. If suspicion is raised concerning government complicity or
                negligence, serious loss of public confidence in government agencies or the legal
                process may result. In this case, the integrity impact level will be moderate. When
                the modification or destruction of legal defense information endangers public safety
                (e.g., release of a terrorist or other murderer), the integrity impact will be high.
                Even if public safety is not endangered, the modification or destruction of legal
                defense information may result in expensive and disruptive civil or criminal
                proceedings.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of legal
                investigation information on the ability of responsible agencies to gather
                information about a given party (government agency, citizen, corporation) that would
                be admissible in a court of law, in an attempt to prove guilt or innocence. Special
                Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The consequences of
                unauthorized disclosure of legal investigation information depend 1] on the
                seriousness of the crime involved, 2] timing (e.g., the ability of the criminal40 to
                access the information and use it to commit a crime or to evade detection or
                surveillance), and 3] on the capability criminal to injure witnesses or law
                enforcement officials. In cases where 1) the crimes are not violent and do not
                inextraordinarily large property losses, and 2) there is no indication of a record
                of violence on the part of the criminal, the confidentiality impact may be low or
                moderate. Given the nature of many of the crimes that are the responsibility of
                Federal law enforcement agencies, the consequences associated with unauthorized
                disclosure of legal investigation information will pose a threat to human life or
                result in a loss of major assets. Additionally, when the disclosure concerns matters
                of multi-national interest, such as trade enforcement, tariff agreements, etc., or
                where foreign nationals might be involved, the confidentiality impact will be high.
                Information that reveals the identity and/or location of informants may be of
                particular concern.</p>

            <p>Given potentially serious to severe legal consequences of unauthorized disclosure,
                the provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for legal investigation
                information is moderate.</p>
        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data

                investigation information. Missions supported by legal investigation information are
                not typically tolerant of delay with resultant serious consequences for ongoing
                investigations. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination: Where
                the crimes involved pose a threat to human life and/or result in a loss of major
                assets, the availability impact level recommended for legal investigation
                information is high.</p>

                information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of legal
                investigation information may depend on whether the information is time-critical.
                Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting external
                communications associated with legal investigative organizations (e.g., web pages,
                electronic mail) may adversely affect operations or public confidence in the agency,
                but the damage to the mission would usually be limited. Where unauthorized
                modification or destruction of information has an adverse effect on the
                granting/executing of a search or wiretap warrant or on the success of the
                subsequent prosecution, a serious adverse effect on agency operations may result.
                This can place the agency at a significant disadvantage. Special Factors Affecting
                Integrity Impact Determination: Legal investigation mission requirements may include
                time-critical information. In such cases, major investigations can be jeopardized by
                the unauthorized modification or destruction of legal investigation information.
                Where the criminal case under investigation involves major property losses,
                large-scale financial frauds, poses a threat to key national assets or human life,
                the integrity impact level recommended for legal investigation information is high.
                When legal investigation information addresses international matters, such as trade
                enforcement or tariff agreements or when foreign nationals are involved, the
                integrity level is high. Any deliberate or inadvertent corruption of such
                information could result in catastrophic adverse effects on future operations,
                individual or agency reputations, and human life.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of legal
                prosecution/litigation information on the ability of responsible agencies to present
                a case in a legal proceeding either in a criminal or civil court of law in an
                attempt to prove guilt/responsibility. Dissemination of legal prosecution/litigation
                information is governed by privacy laws and by Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rules of
                Civil Procedure, and other laws governing adversarial legal proceedings. While most
                information associated with legal prosecution/litigation is public, some information
                is sealed by the court or is otherwise protected from disclosure. Violation of rules
                regarding unauthorized disclosure is punishable by law, disbarment, fine, and/or
                imprisonment. Generally, the unauthorized disclosure of legal prosecution/litigation
                information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or
                individuals. In criminal cases, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of legal
                prosecution information are affected by 1] the seriousness of the crime involved, 2]
                timing (e.g., the ability of the criminal to access the information and use it to
                commit a crime or evade detection or surveillance), and 3] the capability of the
                criminal to injure witnesses or law enforcement officials. Special Factors Affecting
                Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where unauthorized disclosure of information
                might have a serious adverse effect on legal prosecution/ litigation, there is a
                presumption of a miscarriage of justice. If an unauthorized disclosure is
                discovered, the legal proceeding is jeopardized (e.g., a mistrial may be declared).
                The cost to the government and others in terms of finance, time, and disruption to
                normal operations can be severe. If suspicion is raised concerning government
                complicity or negligence, serious loss of public confidence in government agencies
                or the legal process may result. In this case, the confidentiality impact of
                unauthorized disclosure will be moderate. Where the life of a complainant, victim,
                witness, or informant may be endangered by disclosure, the confidentiality impact
                will be high. Also, where the consequences of a miscarriage of justice are likely to
                endanger public safety (e.g., release of a terrorist or other murderer), the
                confidentiality impact will be high. Given the nature of many of the crimes that are
                the responsibility of Federal law enforcement agencies, the consequences associated
                with unauthorized disclosure of legal prosecution information must be assumed to
                pose a threat to human life or result in a loss of major assets. Additionally, when
                a legal proceeding concerns matters of trans-national interest, such as trade
                enforcement, tariff agreements, etc., or where foreign nationals might be involved,
                the confidentiality impact will be high. Information that reveals the identity
                and/or location of informants may be of particular concern. [The impact of
                unauthorized disclosure of national security information is outside the scope of
                this guideline.]</p>

        <confidentiality-recommendation>
            <p>Given the public nature of and disclosure rules associated with most
                prosecution/litigation information, the provisional confidentiality impact level
                recommended is low. In cases where 1) the crimes are not violent and do not involve
                extraordinarily large property losses, and 2) there is no indication of a record of

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                resolution facilitation information on the ability of responsible entities to settle
                a dispute between two or more parties (government, citizen, corporation) outside of
                a court of law. While some information associated with resolution facilitation is
                public, much of the information is private and/or proprietary. Unauthorized
                disclosure of such information can disrupt or defeat the dispute resolution process.
                The consequences typically depend on the nature of the dispute. Jeopardy to the
                resolution process will not usually involve threats to critical infrastructures, key
                national assets, or human life. Typically, the unauthorized disclosure of resolution
                facilitation information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency
                operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact
                Determination: Where large monetary amounts and/or violent crimes are involved, the
                confidentiality impact of unauthorized disclosure of resolution facilitation
                information is at least moderate. In exceptional cases human lives may be
                jeopardized by failure of the resolution facilitation process. Additionally, when
                resolution facilitation concerns matters of trans-national interest, such as trade
                enforcement, tariff agreements, etc., or where foreign nationals might be involved,

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of criminal
                incarceration information on the ability of responsible agencies to provide housing,
                custody, and general care for criminals sentenced to serve time in a Federal
                penitentiary. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most criminal
                incarceration information are unlikely to have a serious adverse effect on agency
                operations. The most serious adverse effects are likely to involve exposure of
                information that is proprietary to prisoners that can result in damaging publicity
                for an organization. (Unauthorized disclosure of some information can conceivably
                have serious impact on the status or resolution of appeal actions). The consequences
                of unauthorized disclosures may have an adverse effect on public confidence in the
                agency.</p>

                incarceration information. Criminal incarceration processes are usually tolerant of
                reasonable delays. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination:
                There may be cases (e.g. emergency bulletins affecting prisoner health and/or
                safety) in which emergency dissemination of information regarding life-threatening
                situations is delayed for excessive periods. Such cases can result in a high

                time-critical and results in the premature release of a criminal, unjust retention
                of an individual in the prison system, or harm to a citizen’s reputation or public
                confidence in the government. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact
                Determination: In some cases (e.g., instructions regarding a need to isolate a
                prisoner from the general prison population for personal safety reasons), the
                unauthorized modification or destruction of criminal incarceration information can

            <p>The confidentiality impact level depends on the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                research and development information on the ability of responsible agencies to
                gather and analyze data, disseminate results, and develop new products,
                methodologies, and ideas, and on the degree to which unauthorized disclosure of the
                information can assist hostile institutions to do harm to the interests of the
                government of the United States. Many research and development activities are
                conducted in association with public institutions of higher learning, and the
                findings resulting from those activities are intended for publication. Unauthorized
                disclosure of most research and development information can be expected to have only
                limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special
                Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Most research and
                development information is proprietary. Unauthorized disclosure of proprietary
                information violates several statures and Federal regulations (see Appendix E).
                Pre-publication disclosure or other unauthorized disclosure of research findings can
                have a serious adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
                In such cases, the confidentiality impact level associated with research and
                development is moderate. Premature and/or partial release of preliminary research
                and development information can lead to misleading conclusions by policy makers,
                funding entities, news organizations, and/or the general public. Where the research

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of general
                purpose data and statistics information on the ability of responsible agencies to
                provide empirical, numerical, and related data and information pertaining to the
                current state of the nation in areas such as the economy, labor, weather,
                international trade, etc. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most
                general-purpose data and statistics information would have only a limited adverse
                effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors
                Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized premature disclosure of
                much economic (e.g., agricultural commodity, economic indicators) data and
                statistics information can result in major financial consequences. In some cases,
                premature disclosure of this information can impact major financial markets and
                damage national banking and finance infrastructures. Unauthorized and premature
                disclosure to a single institution (e.g., a major commodity brokerage house), could
                damage faith in general-purpose data and statistics gathering and development
                institutions, result in even more market disruption, and have a severe or
                catastrophic adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. Even when the
                consequences are limited to giving an unfair market advantage to a single financial
                or commercial institution, unauthorized disclosure can have a serious adverse effect
                on public confidence in the agency and its staff. This can result in assignment of a
                moderate impact level to such information.</p>

                guidance and consultative services to support the implementation of a specific
                service to citizens. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of advising and

                the sensitivity of the information with which advisory or consulting entities are
                working. The consequences of unauthorized disclosure of most advising and consulting
                information would have a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets,
                or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination:
                Where consulting support involves classified or other national security information,
                the consequences of unauthorized disclosure can be severe but are outside the scope

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                knowledge dissemination information on the ability of responsible agencies to
                publish or broadcast information. Premature and unauthorized disclosure of

                knowledge dissemination information would have, at most, a limited adverse effect on
                agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting
                Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of some policies
                governing knowledge dissemination missions can be harmful to the agency mission
                (e.g., some internal Voice of America editorial policies). This can result in

        <confidentiality-explanation>
            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                inspections and auditing information on the ability of responsible agencies to
                methodically examine and review regulated activities to ensure compliance with
                standards for regulated activity. If the inspections and auditing data belongs to
                one of the information types described in this guideline, the confidentiality impact
                assigned the data and system is dependent on the nature of the regulated activity.
                Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Unauthorized
                disclosure of inspections and auditing information can alert personnel associated
                with programs being monitored to the focus of inspection or auditing activities.
                With this information, program personnel may divert attention from questionable
                program attributes or hide unfavorable information. Where a major program or human
                safety is at stake, actions taken based on unauthorized disclosure of inspections
                and auditing information can pose a threat to human life or a loss of major assets.
                In such cases, the confidentiality impact is high. National security information and
                national security systems are outside the scope of this guideline.</p>
        </confidentiality-explanation>
        <confidentiality-recommendation>
            <p>Although there are many Federal environments in which unauthorized disclosure will
                have only a limited adverse effect, there are enough circumstances in which serious
                adverse effects on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals can result to
                justify recommendation of a moderate provisional confidentiality impact level for
                inspections and auditing information.</p>
        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to
                inspections and auditing information. In most cases, disruption of access to
                inspections and auditing information is expected to have only a limited adverse
                effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals. Not many inspection or
                auditing operations involve activities for which temporary loss of availability is
                likely to cause significant degradation in mission capability, place the agency at a
                significant disadvantage, result in major damage to major assets, or pose a threat
                to human life.</p>
        </availability-explanation>
        <availability-recommendation>
            <p>For most inspection and audit functions, the recommended provisional availability
                impact level is low.</p>
        </availability-recommendation>
        <integrity-explanation>
            <p>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting
                that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of
                information. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of
                inspections and auditing information can compromise the effectiveness of the
                program. The damage likely to be caused by unauthorized modification or destruction
                may affect inspection or audit results with subsequent serious adverse effects on
                agency operations or public confidence in the agency. The consequences can be
                particularly serious if the destruction or modification of information invalidates
                oversight of major programs or the information threatens human safety. The integrity
                impact level depends on the laws or policies with which compliance is being
                determined and on the criticality of the processes being monitored (e.g.,
                correctness of contract expenditure reporting versus safety regulations affecting
                manned space flight).</p>
        </integrity-explanation>
        <integrity-recommendation>
            <p>Although there are regulatory environments in which a low impact level is
                appropriate, the circumstances associated with most inspections and auditing support
                information require at least a moderate provisional integrity impact level.</p>

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                standards setting/reporting guideline development information on the abilities of
                responsible agencies to establish allowable limits associated with a regulated

                compliance with allowable limits. In a few cases, the unauthorized public
                dissemination of standards or guidelines information can harm the effectiveness of
                the function being supported (e.g., public dissemination of Internal Revenue Service
                audit thresholds for certain deductions). However, most Federal standards and
                guidelines are intended for public dissemination. The consequences of unauthorized
                disclosure of the majority of standards setting/reporting guideline development
                information will result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency
                assets, or individuals. There are some cases for which standards or guidelines

                information infrastructure maintenance information. Disruption of access to
                information infrastructure maintenance information or information systems will
                typically result in denial of access to resources for all affected agencies.
                Typically, disruption of access will have a limited adverse effect on agency

                assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination:
                Exceptions may include emergency response aspects of disaster management or other
                time critical functions (e.g., some systems that support air traffic control
                functions). The availability impact level associated with unauthorized modification
                or destruction of information infrastructure maintenance information needed to

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of federal
                grants information on the ability of responsible agencies to disburse funds to
                non-Federal entities to fund projects or activities. Typically, unauthorized
                disclosure of federal grants information will have only a limited adverse effect on
                agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality
                Impact Determination: In a few cases, records associated with grants may include
                information subject to privacy restrictions (e.g., the Privacy Act of 1974). The
                Privacy Act Information provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal
                Identity and Authentication information type. In many cases, premature and
                unauthorized disclosure can affect the integrity of the grants process, giving an
                unfair competitive advantage to one or more applicants. In such cases, punitive
                consequences and/or loss of public confidence can have a seriously disruptive effect
                on an agency’s operations and mission. In such cases, the confidentiality impact
                level would be moderate. In some cases, federal grants information might be moderate
                to high impact. Also, details of programs for which grants are awarded may be
                sensitive (e.g., research grants for weapons systems project activities). Some
                federal grants information and some grant program details may be classified and
                outside the scope of this guideline.</p>

                individuals in multiple organizations are usually involved in the grants process.
                Therefore, the information maintained by all the individuals/agencies may be
                necessary to alter a grants decision. In most cases, the adverse effects of
                unauthorized modification or destruction of federal grants information on agency
                mission functions or public confidence in the agency is limited. Special Factors
                Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: There are significant differences between
                the ability to modify a document authorizing a payment and the modification of the
                payment itself. The unauthorized modification of a document authorizing a payment is
                less time critical than the modification of the payment itself while the payment is

                imposed on the recipient as to how the money is spent. In the majority of cases,
                unauthorized disclosure of direct transfers to individuals will have only a limited
                adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or individuals. Special Factors
                Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: Many of the records associated with
                the disbursements may include information subject to privacy restrictions (e.g., the

                Unauthorized disclosure of large volumes of information protected under the Privacy

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of direct
                loan information on the ability of responsible agencies to disburse Federal funds to
                non-Federal borrowers under contract terms that require the repayment of such funds
                with or without interest. Much direct loan information includes information covered
                by the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. (The Privacy Act Information
                provisional impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication
                information type.) In most cases, unauthorized disclosure of direct loan information
                will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or
                individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination:
                Unauthorized disclosure of large volumes of information protected under the Privacy
                Act can be expected to have a serious to severe effect on public confidence in the
                agency. In such cases, the confidentiality impact can be moderate.</p>

                loan information on agency mission functions and public confidence in the agency
                will be limited. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: There are
                significant differences between the ability to modify a document authorizing a
                payment and the modification of the payment itself. The unauthorized modification of
                a document authorizing a payment is less time critical than the modification of the
                payment itself while the payment is in transit. Modifications to payments in transit
                will result in immediate inaccurate payments. This can result in assignment of a
                moderate impact level to such information.</p>

        <description>
            <p>General Insurance involves providing protection to individuals or entities against
                specified risks. The specified protection generally involves risks that private

                provision of insurance is necessary to achieve social objectives.</p>

        <confidentiality-explanation>
            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of general
                insurance information on the abilities of responsible agencies to provide protection
                to individuals or entities against specified risks. General insurance activities
                include both insurance issuing and insurance servicing. Insurance issuing is any
                activity such as provider approval, underwriting, and endorsements. The consequences
                of unauthorized disclosure of insurance issuing information will generally result in
                a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.
                Insurance servicing supports activities associated with administering and processing
                insurance include payment processing, initial and final closings, loss mitigation,
                claims management, and retiring insurance. The confidentiality impact level is the
                effect of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing information on the
                abilities of responsible agencies to administer and process insurance. The
                consequences of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing information will
                generally result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
                individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The
                more serious consequences may result from 1) unauthorized disclosure of provider’s
                proprietary information, or 2) premature disclosure of agency plans or changes under
                consideration for contracts, plans, or policies. Unauthorized disclosure of
                information that can affect contract arrangements to the detriment of the interests
                of the government, and of the public at large (e.g., planned or anticipated
                termination of a major contract insurer), can result in damaging increases in public
                expense and exposure to impact. In the case of unauthorized disclosure to an
                individual private sector organization, unfair competitive advantage may result –
                with major financial consequences. In the case of unauthorized disclosure of
                preliminary and unsubstantiated data that is both incorrect and pessimistic (e.g.,
                Medicare budget projections,), the consequent unwarranted alarm of the public may
                have serious political and operational consequences for affected agencies. In the
                more serious cases, the confidentiality impact will be at least moderate. The more
                serious consequences of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing information
                may result from unauthorized disclosure of private information concerning the
                insured (e.g., Privacy Act information). (The Privacy Act Information provisional
                impact levels are documented in the Personal Identity and Authentication information
                type.) In the more serious cases, the confidentiality impact will be at least
                moderate.</p>

                of reasonable delays. Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact Determination:
                Extensive delays in insurance servicing activities can result in financial harm for
                individuals and businesses and in public alarm and repercussions in the financial
                markets. In more serious cases, delays may have serious political and operational
                consequences for affected agencies. In such cases, the confidentiality impact may be

            <p>The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of
                earmarked grants information on the ability of responsible Federal government
                entities to distribute money to State and Local Governments for a named purpose or
                service usually specifically noted by Congress in appropriations language, or other
                program authorizing language. In the majority of cases, earmarked grants information
                is public knowledge. Typically, unauthorized disclosure of most earmarked grants
                information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or
                individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In some
                cases, project/competitive grants information may be sensitive with moderate to high
                impact. In a few cases, details of programs for which grants are awarded may be
                classified and outside the scope of this guideline.</p>

            <p>The provisional confidentiality impact level recommended for earmarked grants
                information is low.</p>
        </confidentiality-recommendation>
        <availability-explanation>
            <p>The availability impact level is based on the specific mission and the data
                supporting that mission, not on the time required to re-establish access to
                earmarked grants information. Earmarked grants processes are generally tolerant of
                delay. In most cases, disruption of access to earmarked grants information will have
                only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or
                individuals.</p>

            <p>The integrity impact level is based on the specific mission and the data supporting
                that mission, not on the time required to detect the modification or destruction of
                information. Earmarked grants activities are not generally time-critical and
                multiple individuals in multiple organizations are usually involved in the grants
                process. Therefore, the information maintained by all the individuals/agencies is
                probably necessary to alter a grants decision. In most cases, the adverse effects of
                unauthorized modification or destruction of earmarked grants information on agency
                mission functions or public confidence in the agency will be limited.</p>

                information on agency mission functions and public confidence in the agency will be
                limited. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: There are
                significant differences between the ability to modify a document authorizing a
                payment and the modification of the payment itself. The unauthorized modification of
                a document authorizing a payment is less time critical than the modification of the
                payment itself while the payment is in transit. Modifications to payments in transit
                will result in immediate inaccurate payments. This can result in assignment of a
                moderate impact level to such information.</p>

        <title>Military Operations</title>
        <description>
            <p>The BRM provided in the FEA Consolidated Reference Model Document, Version 2.3,
                October 2007 does not define the Military Operations information type. For the
                purpose of this document, Military Operations describes the direct provision of
                military service for the citizens. Further, the BRM specifies Military Operations as
                a Mode of Delivery business area or a vehicle by which the federal government
                delivers it services to citizens. Therefore, agency personnel should consider the
                Military Operations information type as delivery mechanisms of the mission-based
                services information types [e.g., Catastrophic Defense, Emergency Response, Key
                Asset and Critical Infrastructure Protection] described heretofore.</p>
