The confidentiality impact of policy and guidance information is\n                largely event-driven.

Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination:\n                The effects of loss of confidentiality of guidelines during the formative stage can\n                result in attempts by affected entities and other interested parties to influence\n                and/or impede the policy and guideline development process.

Such unauthorized disclosure may also equip\n                an adversary with the information necessary to attack a system in such a way that\n                operations are disrupted, and that recovery is impaired or even blocked. The purpose\n                of most service recovery information is to protect against natural catastrophes\n                rather than against malicious attacks. In most cases, the consequence of loss of\n                confidentiality of service recovery information is not likely to do serious harm to\n                government assets, personnel, or missions. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality\n                Impact Determination: Unauthorized disclosure of background information that\n                supports development of Federal service recovery plans can reveal sensitive\n                vulnerabilities, capabilities, intelligence assessments, intelligence sources, or\n                methods employed in anti-terrorism, law enforcement, or national security\n                activities. Depending on the information in question, the confidentiality impact can\n                be moderate, high, or involve national security information (outside the scope of\n                this guideline). Also, some service recovery plans are themselves national security\n                information."},

The effects of loss of\n                confidentiality of information associated with Congressional liaison can facilitate\n                attempts by competing interests to influence and/or impede a specific legislative\n                process or poison inter-branch relations.

These consequences are particularly likely where the release includes\n                unedited internal commentary and discussion.

The IRS Guidebook for Information Sensitivity Analysis provides guidelines\n                for identifying IRS Official Use Only (OUO) Information. Sensitive information is\n                identified in the IRM as any information which if lost, stolen, (accessed), or\n                altered without proper authorization may adversely affect Service operations. The\n                IRM states that unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information may cause lawsuits\n                against Service officials as well as the Service, unwanted notoriety for the\n                Service, and public distrust of the Service\u2019s ability to protect such information \u2013\n                all of which may result in an increase in noncompliance with tax laws. It notes that\n                unauthorized release of information such as the name and address of an informant (in\n                cases of tax evasion or fraud) may threaten a person\u2019s life.17 Additionally,\n                sensitive information is defined in Section 25.10 of the IRM as information that\n                requires protection due to the risk or magnitude of loss that could result from\n                inadvertent or deliberate disclosure of the information. Sensitive information\n                includes information whose improper use could adversely affect the ability of the\n                agency to accomplish its mission, proprietary information, records about individuals\n                that require protection under the Privacy Act, and information not releasable under\n                the Freedom of Information Act. The IRS OUO guideline notes that prevention of\n                unauthorized disclosure of information revealing internal matters, the disclosure of\n                which would risk circumvention of a legal requirement or agency rules and\n                regulations has assumed an increasingly important role in homeland security.\n                Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or private IRS information can be expected to\n                have a serious effect on both the welfare of individuals and public confidence in\n                the government. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: In\n                cases where unauthorized disclosure of taxation information can impede\n                anti-terrorism or other homeland security activities or endanger the lives of agents\n                or informants, the confidentiality impact level is high."},

Unauthorized disclosure of\n                confidentiality of information associated with ensuring security of transportation\n                and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United\n                States can result in facilitation of terrorist activities that endanger human life.\n                In some cases, the consequent threat to critical infrastructures, key national\n                assets, and human life can be catastrophic. Consequently, the confidentiality impact\n                level associated with information associated with ensuring security of\n                transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel\n                within the United States is normally high"},

Functions and processes supported by most border control\n                information are not time-critical. Also, disruption of access will have only a\n                limited adverse effect on agency operations (including mission functions and public\n                confidence in the agency), agency assets, or individuals. Special Factors Affecting\n                Availability Impact Determination: There may be time critical cases, for example,\n                information regarding transport of illegal aliens or information about a physical\n                threat posed by aliens that border control personnel have been assigned to\n                interdict. In such cased, the availability impact will be high. The consequences of\n                disruption of access to information or information systems associated with ensuring\n                security of transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and\n                personnel within the United States may be severe. Also, anti-terrorism missions are\n                not reliably tolerant of delays. The availability impact level for information\n                systems that ensure the security of transportation and infrastructure networks,\n                facilities, vehicles, and personnel within the United States is high."},
                "availability-recommendation": {"p": "Except for such time-critical cases, cases where impact is driven by information\n                shared with associated missions (e.g., anti-terrorism), the provisional availability\n                impact level recommended for border control information is normally moderate."},

Unauthorized modification or destruction of information affecting\n                external communications (e.g., web pages, electronic mail) may adversely affect\n                operations or public confidence in the agency, but the damage to the mission would\n                usually be limited. The consequences of unauthorized modification or destruction of\n                information can be very serious if the information is critical to tactical\n                operations. Special Factors Affecting Integrity Impact Determination: Unauthorized\n                modification or destruction of information associated with ensuring security of\n                transportation and infrastructure networks, facilities, vehicles, and personnel\n                within the United States may seriously affect mission operations or result in the\n                loss of human life.

Also, the unauthorized disclosure of supply information\n                may assist terrorists in the theft of energy products or disruption of energy\n                distribution channels. Facilitation of theft of nuclear materials is a particularly\n                catastrophic potential result of unauthorized disclosure of specific types of energy\n                supply information. In these cases, the confidentiality impact must be considered to\n                be high. [Some information regarding transportation and storage of nuclear materials\n                is classified. The classified information is national security related and is\n                outside the scope of this guideline. Other information, such as Nuclear Regulatory\n                Commission \u201cSAFEGUARDS\u201d information is not national security information, but must\n                be treated as having high confidentiality impact.] With respect to possible use by\n                terrorists of energy distribution information regarding petroleum, natural gas, and\n                other flammable or explosive products, a realistic impact assessment must include\n                energy distribution information from private companies. This information is also\n                susceptible to access by terrorists. Where distribution of hazardous energy products\n                is involved, there is a potential unauthorized disclosure consequence of loss of\n                human life and major property. In such cases the confidentiality impact level can be\n                moderate or high. [Disclosure of transportation routes and storage facilities is\n                often (i) both authorized and necessary to mission accomplishment and (ii)\n                authorized, or even mandated, for public safety reasons.] Also, the unauthorized\n                disclosure of one agency\u2019s energy supply information by another agency could result\n                in negative impacts on cross-jurisdictional coordination within the energy\n                distribution infrastructure and the general effectiveness of organizations tasked\n                with energy supply."},

                "confidentiality-explanation": {"p": "The confidentiality impact level is the effect of unauthorized disclosure of\n                financial sector oversight information on the ability of responsible agencies to\n                regulate private sector firms and markets (stock exchanges, corporations, etc.) to\n                protect investors from fraud, monopolies, and illegal behavior. This also includes\n                deposit protection, creation, regulation, and control of the nation\u2019s currency and\n                coinage supply and demand. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact\n                Determination: While the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of some financial\n                sector oversight information would have only a limited adverse effect on agency\n                operations, agency assets, or individuals, there are significant exceptions.\n                Unauthorized disclosure of much financial sector oversight information can result in\n                major financial consequences. This can result in assignment of a high impact level\n                to such information. In some cases, premature disclosure of regulatory information\n                can impact major financial markets and damage national banking and finance\n                infrastructures. For example, unauthorized disclosure of a decision to increase the\n                money supply or of an ongoing securities fraud investigation can have a dramatic\n                effect on financial markets. This can result in assignment of a high impact level to\n                such information. Unauthorized disclosure to a single institution (e.g., a major\n                banking institution or brokerage house), could damage faith in regulatory\n                institutions and result in even more market disruption and have a severe or\n                catastrophic adverse effect on public confidence in the agency. This can result in\n                assignment of a high impact level to such information. Even where the consequences\n                are limited to giving an unfair market advantage to a single financial or commercial\n                institution, unauthorized disclosure can have a serious adverse effect on public\n                confidence in the agency and its staff. This can result in assignment of a high\n                impact level to such information."},

Special Factors Affecting Availability Impact\n                Determination: Some air transportation functions are time-critical (e.g., air\n                traffic control instructions, position reports, situational awareness, separation,\n                weather reports for the terminal area, microburst tracking, maintenance trouble\n                reports). Loss of availability of time-critical information necessary to these\n                functions can result in large-scale property loss and in loss of human lives. Timing\n                plays a large part in the availability impact of air transportation information. For\n                example, the time criticality of weather information may be measured in minutes or\n                hours in the case of pre-flight and mid-flight operations. However, on final landing\n                approach, up to the second availability may be required (e.g., detection of\n                microbursts in the terminal area). Air operations are not tolerant of information\n                loss. The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) supplements the availability of\n                information available from the Department of Defense's Global Positioning Systems\n                (GPS). Because of the potential system-wide impacts from a loss of availability of\n                this system, it would be appropriately categorized as having a high availability\n                impact. The following example illustrates the use of controls to address a high\n                integrity impact level: The systems designed for command and control for air traffic\n                control (e.g., the NAS systems) have been designed for robust operations. However,\n                in general, loss of availability for the majority of systems does not cause\n                derogation in safety. The impacts of a loss of availability (or the loss of\n                availability due to the loss of integrity) include local or system-wide air traffic\n                delays, diversion of traffic to alternate airports, etc., and the economic losses\n                related to those delays, diversions, etc. Severe impacts are not the norm because\n                the loss of availability is inevitable, and the systems have been designed to\n                accommodate failures. In light of the above, the Recommended Availability Impact\n                Level is moderate."},

Communications\n                management (e.g., frequency management) information also needs to be included in air\n                transportation integrity impact considerations.

The following example\n                illustrates the use of controls to address a high integrity impact level: Systems\n                designed for command and control for air traffic control (e.g., the NAS systems)\n                have been designed for robust operations. In the NAS, integrity and availability\n                issues are closely linked. The loss of integrity in a system is monitored\n                continuously, and the loss of integrity is treated as a loss of availability, and in\n                general, loss of availability for the majority of systems does not cause derogation\n                in safety. That is, if the operational parameters for an Instrument Landing System\n                are detected to be out of established tolerances, the system is immediately removed\n                from service - it is powered down and users are notified that the particular service\n                is not available. In most cases, a loss of availability is preferred to continued\n                availability with degraded integrity. The impacts of the loss of availability due to\n                the loss of integrity include system-wide air traffic delays, diversion of traffic\n                to alternate airports - and the economic losses related to those delays, diversions,\n                etc. Severe impacts are not the norm because the loss of availability is assumed to\n                be inevitable, and the systems have been designed to accommodate failures. In light\n                of the above, the Recommended Integrity Impact Level is moderate."},

Violation of rules\n                regarding unauthorized disclosure is punishable by law, disbarment, fine, and/or\n                imprisonment. Generally, the unauthorized disclosure of legal prosecution/litigation\n                information will have only a limited adverse effect on agency operations, assets, or\n                individuals. In criminal cases, the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of legal\n                prosecution information are affected by 1] the seriousness of the crime involved, 2]\n                timing (e.g., the ability of the criminal to access the information and use it to\n                commit a crime or evade detection or surveillance), and 3] the capability of the\n                criminal to injure witnesses or law enforcement officials. Special Factors Affecting\n                Confidentiality Impact Determination: Where unauthorized disclosure of information\n                might have a serious adverse effect on legal prosecution/ litigation, there is a\n                presumption of a miscarriage of justice. If an unauthorized disclosure is\n                discovered, the legal proceeding is jeopardized (e.g., a mistrial may be declared).\n                The cost to the government and others in terms of finance, time, and disruption to\n                normal operations can be severe. If suspicion is raised concerning government\n                complicity or negligence, serious loss of public confidence in government agencies\n                or the legal process may result. In this case, the confidentiality impact of\n                unauthorized disclosure will be moderate. Where the life of a complainant, victim,\n                witness, or informant may be endangered by disclosure, the confidentiality impact\n                will be high. Also, where the consequences of a miscarriage of justice are likely to\n                endanger public safety (e.g., release of a terrorist or other murderer), the\n                confidentiality impact will be high. Given the nature of many of the crimes that are\n                the responsibility of Federal law enforcement agencies, the consequences associated\n                with unauthorized disclosure of legal prosecution information must be assumed to\n                pose a threat to human life or result in a loss of major assets. Additionally, when\n                a legal proceeding concerns matters of trans-national interest, such as trade\n                enforcement, tariff agreements, etc., or where foreign nationals might be involved,\n                the confidentiality impact will be high. Information that reveals the identity\n                and/or location of informants may be of particular concern. [The impact of\n                unauthorized disclosure of national security information is outside the scope of\n                this guideline.]"},

General insurance activities\n                include both insurance issuing and insurance servicing. Insurance issuing is any\n                activity such as provider approval, underwriting, and endorsements. The consequences\n                of unauthorized disclosure of insurance issuing information will generally result in\n                a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or individuals.\n                Insurance servicing supports activities associated with administering and processing\n                insurance include payment processing, initial and final closings, loss mitigation,\n                claims management, and retiring insurance. The confidentiality impact level is the\n                effect of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing information on the\n                abilities of responsible agencies to administer and process insurance. The\n                consequences of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing information will\n                generally result in a limited adverse effect on agency operations, agency assets, or\n                individuals. Special Factors Affecting Confidentiality Impact Determination: The\n                more serious consequences may result from 1) unauthorized disclosure of provider\u2019s\n                proprietary information, or 2) premature disclosure of agency plans or changes under\n                consideration for contracts, plans, or policies. Unauthorized disclosure of\n                information that can affect contract arrangements to the detriment of the interests\n                of the government, and of the public at large (e.g., planned or anticipated\n                termination of a major contract insurer), can result in damaging increases in public\n                expense and exposure to impact. In the case of unauthorized disclosure to an\n                individual private sector organization, unfair competitive advantage may result \u2013\n                with major financial consequences. In the case of unauthorized disclosure of\n                preliminary and unsubstantiated data that is both incorrect and pessimistic (e.g.,\n                Medicare budget projections,), the consequent unwarranted alarm of the public may\n                have serious political and operational consequences for affected agencies. In the\n                more serious cases, the confidentiality impact will be at least moderate. The more\n                serious consequences of unauthorized disclosure of insurance servicing information\n                may result from unauthorized disclosure of private information concerning the\n                insured (e.g., Privacy Act information).
