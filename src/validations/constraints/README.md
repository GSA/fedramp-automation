# FedRAMP OSCAL Constraints

## What are they?

FedRAMP's OSCAL Constraints are machine-readable checks to validate [one or more OSCAL documents](https://automate.fedramp.gov/documentation/general-concepts/oscal-file-concepts/) in a digital authorization package meet FedRAMP's requirements and recommendations to follow best practices.

```

To use these constraints, you must download software that supports processing FedRAMP OSCAL Constraints. The [`oscal-cli`](https://github.com/metaschema-framework/oscal-cli/) has the most comprehensive support for the constraint processing and necessary supporting functions. This document will guide you through different ways to install the software and necessary support files. It will also guide you through checking a document with OSCAL constraints, and analyze results to know if the file conforms with FedRAMP's guidelines or changes are necessary. Once you do so, you will increase your confidence in your submission of a digital authorization package before review by FedRAMP's automated systems or reviewers.

## Who should use FedRAMP OSCAL Constraints?

FedRAMP makes these constraints and tools for FedRAMP OSCAL implementers, practitioners, and content authors, including cloud service providers (CSPs), OSCAL tool suppliers, assessors, and federal agencies.

## What is `oscal-cli`?

The `oscal-cli` is a [command-line application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) with important functionality for working with OSCAL documents. One important functionality is checking FedRAMP OSCAL documents. You can use the installed OSCAL models and FedRAMP's OSCAL Constraints to check your documents meet FedRAMP's requirements.

The tool

1. Validates your OSCAL content against existing FedRAMP OSCAL constraints.
2. Identifies areas, where your OSCAL content meets and does not meet FedRAMP OSCAL requirements.
3. Produces a SARIF report, containing details about passed and failed OSCAL content.

## Installation

There are multiple ways to install the constraints and the `oscal-cli` tool to check OSCAL documents with constraints. FedRAMP recommends you use [the Docker container engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/), or an alternative [OCI-conformant](https://opencontainers.org/) container runtime, to download the most recent version of the constraint files, `oscal-cli`, and their dependencies. Dockers allows you to download the software pre-compiled and pre-configured without additional manual steps.

## Recommended installation with containers

### Prerequisites

Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [an alternative](https://hackernoon.com/5-docker-desktop-alternatives). (**NOTE:** This application, and popular alternatives, simplify the management of a container engine on your computer with a user-friendly interface. Although Docker Desktop is popular, FedRAMP cannot recommend or endorse one particular container management tool, and Docker Desktop's license [does not permit free use in many scenarios](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/desktop-license/), so you need to _may_ purchase a license. Vet Docker Desktop or any alternatives by reading the license and user reviews to make an informed choice. If you have an employer that manages a computer for you, contact the employer's IT staff, show them this documentation, and consult with them on the best software choice that complies with employer policy.)

### Installing the container image

1. Install [the necessary prerequisites](#prerequisites) for Docker or another OCI container engine.
2. Open a shell to run command-line applications on your computer.
   - For Windows, open the Start Menu and search for `powershell` to open PowerShell.
   - For macOS, open the search bar with the &#8984; and space bar to search for `terminal` to open Terminal.app with a `bash` or `zsh` session. (**NOTE:** The default has changed for different releases of macOS; both work with the FedRAMP tools and these shells are largely cross-compatible).
   - For Linux operating systems, there are many variations of terminal emulators. You need to open any terminal emulator to open a shell, `bash` or `zsh` will work with these tools.
3. Use the `docker` command-line utility to download the latest version of the container. (**NOTE**: The download may take from several seconds to several minutes depending on the speed of your connection.)

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/gsa/fedramp-automation/validation-tools:latest
```

4. When the download is complete and the terminal prompts you for a new shell command, you can check that you correctly downloaded the image by running your first command to [verify the version of `oscal-cli` in the image].

### Upgrading the container image

1. Confirm that you still have [the necessary prerequisites](#prerequisites) for Docker or another OCI container engine installed.
1. Run the following command to upgrade to the latest released version of the container with the FedRAMP tools.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/gsa/fedramp-automation/validation-tools:latest
```

When you use `docker run ... ghcr.io/gsa/fedramp-automation/validation-tools:latest` on your computer, it will use the new version pinned to the `latest` tag that you recently downloaded instead of the previous version.

### Test the container image with your first command

After you [downloaded the image](#download-the-container-image), you can run your first container command to check the version is correct.

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/gsa/fedramp-automation/validation-tools:latest --version
```

The command above runs the pre-installed and pre-configured release of `oscal-cli` within the container with the command `oscal-cli --version`. If successful, you will see output like the following.

# Validating FedRAMP OSCAL content

This section describes steps for validating FedRAMP OSCAL artifacts (SSP, SAP, SAR, and POA\&M files).

## Understanding the `oscal-cli validate` subcommand

To validate your FedRAMP OSCAL file, you run the oscal-cli via the [the container image](#installing-the-container-image) or directly with [the manual install on your computer](#manual-installation-without-containers-for-advanced-users) with the following arguments.

For the container-based install, the command will resemble the following.

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v <host-oscal-artifact-directory>:/data ghcr.io/gsa/fedramp-automation/validation-tools:latest validate <oscal-artifact> -c <fedramp-external-constraints> -o <sarif-output> --sarif-include-pass
```

For the manual install, the command will resemble the following.

```bash
oscal-cli validate <oscal-artifact> -c <fedramp-external-constraints> -o <sarif-output> --sarif-include-pass
```

   where
	* `<oscal-artifact>`is your SSP, SAR, SAP, or POA\&M file
	* `<fedramp-external-constraints>` is the name of a FedRAMP external constraints file (for example, **fedramp-external-allowed-values.xml**; you may specify more than one file)
	* `<sarif-output>` is the name of a validation report file that the tool generates in the JSON-based SARIF format (for example, **report.sarif**; for more information about SARIF, visit [https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html))
	* `--sarif-include-pass` is the option to include passed validation results in the SARIF report (by default, the SARIF output includes only failed validations; if you want only the failed results, omit this option)
   * <host-oscal-artifact-directory> is *only* for use with the container. It is the directory where store your FedRAMP OSCAL files on the computer. Inside the container, those files are mounted in the `/data` directory, so you will reference the files' location there when using the container.

## Validation command examples

For example, you can run the following command a container with the FedRAMP OSCAL Constraints, opening a [terminal](#installing-the-container-image), mounting your current folder with a volume mount, and running the `oscal-cli` from within a container.

### Running example commands in the container

For this example, if you have a computer with the Windows operating system, run the following command with Powershell.

```powershell
docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/data ghcr.io/gsa/fedramp-automation/validation-tools:latest validate /data/ssp.xml -c fedramp-external-allowed-values.xml -o /data/ssp-validation-results.sarif --sarif-include-pass
```

For this example, if you have a computer with macOS or Linux operating systems, run the following command with Powershell.

```powershell
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/data ghcr.io/gsa/fedramp-automation/validation-tools:latest validate /data/ssp.xml -c fedramp-external-allowed-values.xml -o /data/ssp-validation-results.sarif --sarif-include-pass
```

In these examples, you used the `oscal-cli` to validate your own SSP in your current directory and write out the results into a SARIF file in the same folder on your computer thanks to volume mount.

### Running example commands with a manual installation

For example, run the following command with a manual install:
`oscal-cli validate ssp.xml -c fedramp-external-allowed-values.xml -o ssp-validation-results.sarif --sarif-include-pass`

To view a complete list of
  * `oscal-cli` commands, run the following command:
     `oscal-cli --help`
  * Specific command options, run the following command:
     `oscal-cli <command> --help`

## Fixing validation errors

The tool generates validation reports in the JSON-based SARIF format. For more information about SARIF, visit [https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html).

If you prefer viewing SARIF reports in a GUI application, Visual Studio Code offers the **SARIF Viewer** extension. For more information, visit [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WDGIS.MicrosoftSarifViewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WDGIS.MicrosoftSarifViewer).

After validating your FedRAMP OSCAL file, to fix validation errors
1. Open the generated SARIF validation report file.
2. Search for **fail**.
3. In the **text** field for the failed validation, note the message (for example, `"The import-profile element must have a reference"`).
4. In the **decoratedName** field, note the XPath expression, which points to the location of the failed test in your OSCAL document (for example, `"/system-security-plan/metadata[1]"`).
5. Open the validated OSCAL file.
6. Find the location referenced in the **decoratedName** field.
7. Fix the error.
8. Re-run the validation.
